AST's are pretty boring, huh?  Just parse, get a tree?  Nuh-uh.  My
compilers prof a college at the University of Washington started
off with the statement that parsing was completely solved problem
and was boring and that nobody was looking at it any more and, boy
oh boy, was he ever wrong.  We have found some really interesting
parsing problems.  I mean when you get into multi-language of course
it gets pretty crazy but, uh, even the representation of the parsed
code -- everyone has a completely different idea of what it means.
