</center>
<h2>Is the Perl interpreter psychic?</h2>
<p>An important consequence of the choice of parsing algorithm
is the
<a href="#NOTE1">handling of parse-time errors</a>.
It's often overlooked.
Perl's use of LALR based parsing puts severe limits on its
ability to locate errors,
limits which the Perl interpreter is sometimes able to overcome.
Consider the following erroneous piece of code.
<pre>
<code class="prettyprint">
my $lyric =
'Sloopy wears a red dress, yeah
As old as the hills
but when sloopy wears that red dress, yeah
you know it gives me the chills
Sloopy when I see you walking, 
walking down the street
I say don't worry sloopy, girl
You belong to me';
print "$lyric\n";
</code>
</pre>
<p>Some of you may have spotted this as the lost third verse of the
October 1965 US #1 hit, "Hang on Sloopy".
Others may notice that the single quote in "don't"
is going to make things come out pear-shaped.
On this latter point,
the Perl interpreter's performance is uncanny, if a bit noisy:
<p><pre>
<code class="prettyprint">
Bareword found where operator expected at bomb.pl line 8, near "I say don't"
  (Might be a runaway multi-line '' string starting on line 2)
        (Do you need to predeclare I?)
syntax error at bomb.pl line 8, near "I say don't worry "
Bad name after me' at bomb.pl line 9.
</code>
</pre>

<p>I just said that Perl's LALR-based parsing made error detection difficult.
So how do I explain the above, where the error detection is not merely good,
it almost seems psychic?
<h2>Behind the Smoke and Mirrors</h2>
<p>A closer look will show how Perl pulls off this bit of apparent
mind-reading.
If you look at <var>toke.c</var>, you'll see the trick.
Globals in the tokenizer track the beginning and ending of the 
most recent multi-line object.
Anytime a multi-line object ends just before an error,
the Perl interpreter fingers it.
It's a bit like police lieutenant Arthur Tragg in the old Perry Mason
series, who on discovering a murder victim, always arrested the next
person he saw -- usually Mason's client.
It's a good guess and,
unlike the indefatigable Arthur Tragg,
who persisted despite turning out to be wrong week after week,
it works for the Perl interpreter most of the time.
<p>But not always.
Let's rearrange this example, so that the string is OK,
and we're depending on the LALR parser to locate an error.
<p><pre>
<code class="prettyprint">
my $lyric =
'Sloopy wears a red dress, yeah
As old as the hills
but when sloopy wears that red dress, yeah
you know it gives me the chills
Sloopy when I see you walking, 
walking down the street
I say don\'t worry sloopy, girl
You belong to me'~!@$%^&*()_+;
print "$lyric\n";
</code>
</pre>
<p><pre>
<code class="prettyprint">
Bareword found where operator expected at bomb2.pl line 9, near ")_"
        (Missing operator before _?)
syntax error at bomb2.pl line 9, near "You belong to me'~"
  (Might be a runaway multi-line '' string starting on line 2)
Execution of bomb2.pl aborted due to compilation errors.

</code>
</pre>
<p>This example clearly illustrates the limits of LALR parsing.
A multi-line string just
ended, and the tokenizer duly drops the dime,
but there's no way to make the charge stick.
The multi-line string is fine,
and the problem is somewhere in the special characters after it.

<p>
But where?
Now that we are no longer dazzled by the psychic abilities of the tokenizer,
let's carefully define what we mean by the actual error location.
The error location is the first character which makes a valid parse impossible.
Put another way, if a parser reads a character, and that character renders
it impossible that any subsequent reading of characters
will produce a valid parse, then the location
of that character is the error location.

<p>Where is the error location in this example?
I think it may be at the '%' sign,
but I frankly don't know.
More to the point, neither does the Perl interpreter,
though it throws out guesses all over the map.

<h2>The Immediate Error Detection Property</h2>
<p>The error-locating ability of parsing algorithms divides them into
two types.
"Immediate error detection" is what you'd like to see in a parser --
the moment the parser encounters a character which makes a valid parse
impossible, it knows it.
Other parsers, and LALR is prominent among them, need to grind on,
reading more characters.
Only later do they realize something has gone wrong.

<p>When recursive descent is full LL(1) it has the immediate error detection
property.
(In simplified terms, recursive descent is full LL(1) when it is
smart about lookahead for
empty rules.)
Recursive descent implementations which are not full LL(1) do not
have the immediate error detection property.
This is the case with most actual implementations of
recursive descent.
On the other hand,
recursive descent's major attraction is that it is hack-friendly,
so that a recursive descent implementation which is less than full LL(1)
in theory might well
do immediate error detection when it counts.

<p>Earley's algorithm has the immediate error detection property.
My implementation of it in
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
has the
immediate error detection property and then some.
When it is about to read a token,
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
knows, and can inform the lexer,
exactly which input symbols
will result in a viable parse.
This allows <a
href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/2010/06/parsing-with-ruby-slippers.html">

some very nice tricks</a>.
<p><a name="#NOTE1"><b>Note 1</b></a>:
For the readers of my last post on <var>yacc</var>,
the discussion of error reporting here changes the subject:
That post dealt with the reporting of errors by a parser generator while the parser is
being generated: generation-time error reporting.
This post changes the topic to the reporting of errors in its input by a parser:
parse-time error reporting.
My next post in the
<var>yacc</var>
series will discuss
<var>yacc</var>'s
parse-time error reporting.
<p>For a hand-written parser, of course, there is no such thing as generation-time,
and therefore generation-time error reporting is a non-issue.
Parse-time error reporting is an issue for all parsers,
whether generated or hand-written.

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
Also,
I will continue to dual-post for some time,
and have not yet frozen comments on the versions of the
