<center><a name="announcing-marpaxs-0010000"> <h2>Announcing Marpa::XS 0.010000</h2> </a>
</center>
<p>
Some time ago I released
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-XS-0.010000/">
Marpa::XS 0.010000</a>.
The core Marpa algorithm had already been converted to C,
speeding it up considerably.
Marpa::XS 0.010000 cleans up a lot of code left over from development,
further speeding things up.
</p>
<h1>What is Marpa?</h1>
<p>Marpa is an advance over recursive descent
and yacc.
I hope the Marpa algorithm
will become the standard parser for
problems too
big for regular expressions.
</p><ul>
<li>Marpa parses, in linear time,  all
classes of grammar that are currently in practical use.
(<a href="#NOTE1">See Note 1</a>).
</li>
<li>The importance of parse-time debugging is often underestimated.
Marpa's parse-time error detection breaks new ground -- Marpa is
fully aware of exactly where in the parse it is at all times,
and of exactly what input it expects and why.
This means parse-time error detection, once a desperate last
resort, now can be used as
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/2010/06/parsing-with-ruby-slippers.html">
a parsing technique in itself</a>.

</li>
<li>Marpa is a general BNF parser -- that means if you feed it anything
written in BNF, it "just parses" it.
This includes grammars which are left-recursive, right-recursive and
ambiguous -- even infinitely ambiguous.
</li>
<li>Marpa never goes exponential -- worst case, even for highly ambiguous
grammars, is O(n**3), which is considered optimal
(<a href="#NOTE2">See Note 2</a>).
</li>
</ul>
<h1>What is Next with Marpa?</h1>
I had planned to skip this announcement and wait to announce
Marpa::XS 0.012000.
I expected
the release of Marpa::XS 0.012000
to be just days away.
And I did produce
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-XS-0.013_003/">
its release candidate</a>
almost immediately.
But in the meantime cpantesters was hit with a prolonged outage,
which continues as of this writing.
I've always waited for a few days of cpantesters results on
the release candidate before cutting an official release
and I hope cpantesters will be back online soon.

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
Also,
I will continue to dual-post for some time,
and have not yet frozen comments on the versions of the
post at
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>.
