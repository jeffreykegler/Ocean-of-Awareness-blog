<center><a name="perl-and-parsing-9-use-and-the-ruby-slippers"> <h2>Perl and Parsing 9: "Use" and the Ruby Slippers</h2> </a>
</center>
<p>
In this post, I talk about how
Perl 5 parses its
<code class="prettyprint">use</code> statement.
The <code class="prettyprint">use</code> statement
is implemented with
what I have named
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/2010/06/parsing-with-ruby-slippers.html">
"Ruby Slippers" parsing</a>.
The idea is that you parse with a convenient grammar,
but one which is too simple to actually describe the language
you are parsing.
For example, if you are parsing HTML, the grammar might assume
all start tags have end tags.
</p>
<p>
Whenever the simplified grammar has trouble parsing,
the lexer fixes the situation by pretending the input
is what the parser wants to see.
The parser is like Dorothy in
the <em>Wizard of Oz</em>, who really would
like to be back in Kansas.
The lexer is like the good witch,
Glenda, who assures Dorothy that,
because of her Ruby Slippers,
Dorothy really can be wherever she wants to be.
</p>

<p>
Few "new" programming ideas are so new
that they have no
precedent in previous practice.
Perl 5 put the Ruby Slippers technique
to work well before I described and named it.
Its code captures the two essential elements of
Ruby Slippers parsing.
</p>
<h2>The Syntax of the <code class="prettyprint">use</code> Statement</h2>
<p>
As a reminder, the 
<code class="prettyprint">use</code> statement comes in several forms.
Most of them are <a href="#MODULE">module</a>
requests --
that is, they request the loading of a module.
In the long form of the module request, a version number
is specified as well.  The version number is usually
interpreted as the minimum acceptable version of
that module.
<pre>

use Module VERSION
</pre>
For example,
<code class="prettyprint">
<pre>
use List::Util 1.21;
</pre>
</code>

<center><a name="announcing-marpaxs-0010000"> <h2>Announcing Marpa::XS 0.010000</h2> </a>
</center>
<p>
Some time ago I released
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-XS-0.010000/">
Marpa::XS 0.010000</a>.
The core Marpa algorithm had already been converted to C,
speeding it up considerably.
Marpa::XS 0.010000 cleans up a lot of code left over from development,
further speeding things up.
</p>
<h1>What is Marpa?</h1>
<p>Marpa is an advance over recursive descent
and yacc.
I hope the Marpa algorithm
will become the standard parser for
problems too
big for regular expressions.
</p><ul>
<li>Marpa parses, in linear time,  all
classes of grammar that are currently in practical use.
(<a href="#NOTE1">See Note 1</a>).
</li>
<li>The importance of parse-time debugging is often underestimated.
Marpa's parse-time error detection breaks new ground -- Marpa is
fully aware of exactly where in the parse it is at all times,
and of exactly what input it expects and why.
This means parse-time error detection, once a desperate last
resort, now can be used as
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/2010/06/parsing-with-ruby-slippers.html">
a parsing technique in itself</a>.

</li>
<li>Marpa is a general BNF parser -- that means if you feed it anything
written in BNF, it "just parses" it.
This includes grammars which are left-recursive, right-recursive and
ambiguous -- even infinitely ambiguous.
</li>
<li>Marpa never goes exponential -- worst case, even for highly ambiguous
grammars, is O(n**3), which is considered optimal
(<a href="#NOTE2">See Note 2</a>).
</li>
</ul>
<h1>What is Next with Marpa?</h1>
I had planned to skip this announcement and wait to announce
Marpa::XS 0.012000.
I expected
the release of Marpa::XS 0.012000
to be just days away.
And I did produce
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-XS-0.013_003/">
its release candidate</a>
almost immediately.
But in the meantime cpantesters was hit with a prolonged outage,
which continues as of this writing.
I've always waited for a few days of cpantesters results on
the release candidate before cutting an official release
and I hope cpantesters will be back online soon.

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
Also,
I will continue to dual-post for some time,
and have not yet frozen comments on the versions of the
post at
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>.
