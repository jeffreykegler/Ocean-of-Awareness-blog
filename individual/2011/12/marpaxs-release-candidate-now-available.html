</center>
<p>
I am very happy to announce that
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/JKEGL/Marpa-XS-0.026000/">
the latest release of Marpa::XS</a>
is a release candidate</a> for the first full release,
Marpa::XS 1.000000.
Most user's experience with the previous beta releases
seems to have been trouble-free.
The one significant issue that was identified
was a failure to properly evaluate null symbols under
<a href="#JIROTKA">
an unusual combination of circumstances</a>.
This problem
(a one line error in the C rewrite of the parse engine)
is fixed in this release.
Unusual as the issue is,
when it does occur it results in a parse failure,
so that
I recommend that all users of Marpa::XS upgrade to
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/JKEGL/Marpa-XS-0.026000/">
the latest release</a>.
</p>
<p>
Marpa::XS is being kept stable.
Bug fixes, even of minor and cosmetic bugs,
will be made, as 
will changes that improve maintainability.
But no new features will be added.
Interface changes will be especially avoided.

</p>
<h2>What is Marpa?</h2>
<p>Marpa is an advance over recursive descent
and yacc.
I hope the Marpa algorithm
will become the standard parser for
problems too
big for regular expressions.
</p><ul>
<li>Marpa parses,
<a href="#LINEAR">
in linear time</a>,
those
classes of grammar that are currently in practical use.
</li>
<li>The importance of parse-time debugging is often underestimated.
Marpa's parse-time error detection breaks new ground -- Marpa is
fully aware of exactly where in the parse it is at all times,
and of exactly what input it expects and why.
This means parse-time error detection, once a desperate last
resort, now can be used as
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/2010/06/parsing-with-ruby-slippers.html">
a parsing technique in itself</a>.

</li>
<li>Marpa is a general BNF parser -- that means if you feed it anything
written in BNF, it "just parses" it.
This includes grammars which are left-recursive, right-recursive and
ambiguous -- even infinitely ambiguous.
</li>

<li>Marpa never goes exponential -- worst case, even for highly ambiguous
grammars, is O(n**3), which is
<a href="#OPTIMAL">considered optimal</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>New with this release</h2>
<p>
Since the beta release,
several bugs have been fixed,
The most important one was a failure to properly evaluate
null symbols
<a href="#JIROTKA">under certain unusual circumstances</a>.
This problem, identified and described by
Tom&aacute;&#353; Jirotka,
is fixed in
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/JKEGL/Marpa-XS-0.026000/">
this latest release</a>.
</p>

<p>
In some previous Marpa::XS releases, the
documentation, while part of the distribution,
did not install automatically.
As of this release, that problem is fixed.
The documentation now
installs, as it should,
along with the rest of Marpa::XS.
</p>
<p>
No interface has been deprecated since
Marpa::XS went beta -- the interface has remained stable.
But many interfaces deprecated BEFORE Marpa
went beta were used in the test suite.
To make the test suite more useful for readers,
I eliminated deprecated practices
except in code whose purpose it is
to test that deprecated practice.
Where tests continue to use a deprecated practice,
comments explicitly point this out.
</p>
<h2>What is next with Marpa?</h2>
<p>
Based on the feedback,
I have confidence that Marpa::XS have been extensively
used and found reliable.
With the fixes for this release,
I expect that Marpa::XS can be taken out
of beta and into a full 1.000000 release shortly.
</p>
Development of new features for
Marpa continues, but in another distribution:
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-R2/">Marpa::R2</a>.
This isolates Marpa::XS users from the accidental changes
and bugs that can be the side effect of active development.

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
Also,
I will continue to dual-post for some time,
and have not yet frozen comments on the versions of the
post at
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>.
