<p>
I am very happy to announce that
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-XS-0.018000/">
Marpa::XS is now beta</a>.
Marpa::XS will kept stable.
Changes to its interface will be especially avoided.
</p>
<h1>What is Marpa?</h1>
<p>Marpa is an advance over recursive descent
and yacc.
I hope the Marpa algorithm
will become the standard parser for
problems too
big for regular expressions.
</p><ul>
<li>Marpa parses,
<a href="#LINEAR">
in linear time</a>,
those
classes of grammar that are currently in practical use.
</li>
<li>The importance of parse-time debugging is often underestimated.
Marpa's parse-time error detection breaks new ground -- Marpa is
fully aware of exactly where in the parse it is at all times,
and of exactly what input it expects and why.
This means parse-time error detection, once a desperate last
resort, now can be used as
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/2010/06/parsing-with-ruby-slippers.html">

a parsing technique in itself</a>.

</li>
<li>Marpa is a general BNF parser -- that means if you feed it anything
written in BNF, it "just parses" it.
This includes grammars which are left-recursive, right-recursive and
ambiguous -- even infinitely ambiguous.
</li>
<li>Marpa never goes exponential -- worst case, even for highly ambiguous
grammars, is O(n**3), which is
<a href="#OPTIMAL">considered optimal</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>New with this release</h1>
<p>
Marpa::XS 0.018000 contains two new
ranking methods.
These ranking methods allow applications to control
the order of parse trees within
an ambiguous parse.
The two new ranking methods are the <code class="prettyprint">rule</code>
ranking method and
the <code class="prettyprint">high_rule_only</code> ranking method.
In both methods, integer ranks are assigned to rules,
and alternative parsings are ordered on a top-down, left-to-right basis.
When it comes to comparing choices by rule rank, ties are allowed --
in fact, they are common.
By default, all the alternatives at every choice point
tie with each other.
When they are tied in rank,
the order of choices is arbitrary.

</p>
In the <code class="prettyprint">rule</code> ranking method, all the parse trees are
kept, and visited in order.
In the <code class="prettyprint">high_rule_only</code> ranking method,
only the highest ranked alternatives are kept,
and they are visited in arbitrary order.
Because of ties, more than one of the alternatives at a choice point
can be "highest".
A full description of the new ranking methods
is <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Marpa::XS::Semantics::Order">
in Marpa::XS's documentation</a>.

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
Also,
I will continue to dual-post for some time,
and have not yet frozen comments on the versions of the
post at
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>.
