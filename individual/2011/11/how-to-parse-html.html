</center>
<p>
This is the first of a series of posts that will detail
a Marpa-based "Ruby Slippers"
approach to parsing liberal
and defective HTML.
As an example, let's look at a
few lines
taken more or less at random
from the middle
of the <a href="http://www.perl.org/">perl.org
landing page</a>.
That page is exactly 400 lines long.
Here is line 200 and some lines
lines to either side of it.
<pre>
<code class="prettyprint">
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div class="module"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/"&gt;
&lt;img alt=""
    src="http://mc-cdn.pimg.net/images/icons/onion.vee5cb98.png"
    width="45" height="45" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/"&gt;The Perl Foundation&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Perl Foundation is dedicated to the advancement
of the Perl programming language through open discussion,
collaboration, design, and code.

</pre>
<p>
For readability, I've rearranged
the whitespace, but otherwise the above is untouched.
My more-or-less-random extract is part of a table, and captures the
end tag of one cell and the beginning of another.
</p>
<p>

<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::HTML">Marpa::HTML</a>
has no trouble fixing this up,
but neither does the
rendering engine
in Firefox.
If you cut and paste the above display into a file,
and look at it in your favorite web browser,
the result will probably be quite reasonable.
So why am I saying
that Marpa-based
HTML parsing is a step forward?
</p>
<h2>What's the Big Deal?</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::HTML">Marpa::HTML</a>
as it sits is a flexible and useable tool,
but what makes it different is best appreciated if you think in
terms of
writing, maintaining or
<a href="#FORKING">forking Marpa::HTML</a>.
The rendering engine in your favorite browser
is a monolith of mission-specific code,
and in most cases maintaining it is
the job of a team.
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::HTML">Marpa::HTML</a>
was written in a couple
of geek-weeks.
It is reasonable to expect that even
if a change amounted nearly to
a total rewrite,
it could done in
a similar amount of time.
</p>
<p>

Why is
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::HTML">Marpa::HTML</a>
that much easier to code?
Well, admittedly,
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::HTML">Marpa::HTML</a>
does not do rendering, which
makes life easier.
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::HTML">Marpa::HTML</a>
just parses
HTML, without trying to figure out how to arrange it
on a display.
</p>
<p>
More to our purpose,
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::HTML">Marpa::HTML</a>
divides
HTML parsing into two layers:
an HTML specific layer;
and
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::XS">

a general parsing layer</a>.
Most of the complexity goes into the general parsing
layer, which is in carefully optimized C,
and which contains no HTML-specific code.
The HTML-specific layer is
small and coded in Perl.
<p>
When I started writing 
Marpa::HTML,
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::XS">
my general parsing layer was already written,
tested and ready to go</a>.
I only
needed to write an HTML-specific layer.
Marpa::HTML was my first serious exercise of
the Ruby Slippers,
and my surprise at how easy it was
to use inspired the name.
</p>
<p>
The advantages to breaking up
an HTML parser
into an HTML-specific layer
and a parse engine
can be compared to the advantages that were accrued
by breaking up the original monolithic
web browsers into a user interface and a rendering engine.
The interface of
modern browsers can be changed
without hacking the rendering engine.
The Marpa-powered approach to parsing
HTML allows the programmer to completely change
his approach to HTML without
touching the parse engine.
</p>
As you read this series of posts,
I hope the following will be food for the imagination:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::HTML">Marpa::HTML</a>
could be the basis
of a utility.
Two I have already written are

<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/html_fmt">html_fmt</a>
and
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/html_score">html_score</a>.
<li>A Marpa-powered tool
could take a customized approach to dealing with defects in HTML.
<li>A Marpa-powered tool
could take a configurable approach to dealing with defects in HTML.
<li>A Marpa-powered tool could provide an XS-powered engine to speed up HTML::Tree.
<li>A Marpa-powered tool could understand embedded content,
such as
the HTML-within-HTML used in the displays
in this blog post.
<li>
A Marpa-powered tool could imitate your favorite renderer.
<li>
A Marpa-powered tool could configurably imitate the properties
of many renderers.
<li>
A Marpa-powered tool could prototype the HTML renderer
of your dreams.
<li>
With its HTML-specific layer
recoded in C,
a fork could be the easier-to-maintain
HTML renderer of your dreams.

</ul>
<h2>The Example</h2>
<p>
I will finish this post, by taking a first look at
what
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::HTML">Marpa::HTML</a>
does.
For that,
it is convenient to use
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/html_fmt">html_fmt</a>,
my Marpa-powered HTML "pretty-printer".
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/html_fmt">html_fmt</a>
takes any file fed to it,
interprets it as HTML,
and prints a "prettified" version to the standard output.
It's a good tool for studying HTML interpretation.
Here is what it did with our example:
</p>
<pre>
<code class="prettyprint">
&lt;!-- Following start tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;

&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;!-- Following start tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
  &lt;!-- Following start tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;!-- Following start tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;!-- Following start tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
      &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;!-- Following start tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;

        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;!-- Next line is cruft --&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;div class="module"&gt;
              &lt;a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/"&gt;

                &lt;img alt=""
    src="http://mc-cdn.pimg.net/images/icons/onion.vee5cb98.png"
    width="45" height="45" /&gt;
              &lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;h4&gt;
                &lt;a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/"&gt;
                  The Perl Foundation
                &lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;/h4&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;
                The Perl Foundation is dedicated to the advancement
                of the Perl programming language through open discussion,
                collaboration, design, and code.
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
          &lt;/td&gt;

          &lt;!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
      &lt;/tbody&gt;
      &lt;!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

    &lt;!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;

<p>
Whenever

<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/html_fmt">html_fmt</a>
adds a tag or spots a spurious tag ("cruft") it adds a
comment to that effect.
As you can see from the above,
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/html_fmt">html_fmt</a>
sees that the extract is a
table fragment and builds a table around it.
An interesting exercise is to take both the example
and the 
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/html_fmt">html_fmt</a>
output and look at them in your favorite browser,
comparing
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/html_fmt">html_fmt</a>'s
reconstruction from the HTML fragment with your browser's.
</p>
<p>
In posts to come,
I'll go into detail about the Ruby Slippers,
Marpa-powered,
approach to HTML parsing.

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><a name="FORKING">"forking"</a>:
To be sure,
I consider
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::HTML">Marpa::HTML</a>
a fine tool,
and use it often in my own work.
And it is possible that I will enhance
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::HTML">Marpa::HTML</a>.
But a parser like
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::XS">Marpa</a>
is a tool.
Inventing a new hammer does not
evince
a desire to single-handedly build
every house in the world.
