</center>
  <p>
      <!--

      -->
      Jean-Damien Durand has written MarpaX::Languages::C::AST,
      a tool which parses C language into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
      Recently released, it has been tested against
      Perl's C source code, as well as Marpa's own C source file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because it is Marpa-powered,
      MarpaX::Languages::C::AST works differently from other C parsers.
      C parsers have been either syntax-driven,
      like those parsers based on yacc,
      or based on recursive descent and procedurally-driven.
      MarpaX::Languages::C::AST uses both approaches.
      Marpa has the advantage that it makes full knowledge of the state of the parse
      available to the programmer,
      so that the two approaches can reinforce each other.
    </p>
    <p>The result is a combined lexer/parser
      which is unusually compact, easy-to-understand
      and easy to modify.
      The logic which can be described via syntax (BNF) is implemented from the
      BNF.
      Parsing from the BNF is enough to handle lexing and parsing for almost all of standard C,
      including the
      much discussed
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_else>if-then-else issue</a>.
    </p>
    <p>But C in some aspects is actually context-sensitive -- incapable of being described in BNF.
    In particular, C cannot distinguish type names from variable names using its BNF grammar alone.
    Most C parsers deal with this via either
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_lexer_hack">a lexer hack</a>,
      or a post-processing hack.
      Marpa allows the parser to do this more elegantly.
      Marpa knows the parsing context at all times and can comnunicate this to a user's
      customized lexing code.
      It also allows the parser to switch back and forth between customized parsing and
      its own internal parsing.
      Combined, these two features allow the code to distinguish C variable names from
      C's types to avoid hacks, and to address the issue in a direct and focused way.
      The procedural logic to do this can be limited to the cases were it is necessary.
      And since Marpa is fully aware of parse context,
      the procedural logic does not need to resort to hacks and tricks to make the right
      decisions.
      The resulting code, and parser, is much simpler and clearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Potential uses of MarpaX::Languages::C::AST includes tools, interpreters
      and compilers for the C language.
      This code is open source, and is much easier basis on which
      to create C language supersets and subsets than
      previous C parsers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A C parser can take one of two strategies: approximate or precise.
      A compiler has, of course, to be precise.
      Tools, such as cross-referencers, often decide to be approximate, or sloppy.
      Sloppiness is easier to implement and has other advantages:
      Compilers require the user to get all the C flags right.
      A sloppy tool can tolerate missing flags: what the flags should be
      can be one of the things it guesses at.
    </p>
    <p>Of the two strategies, Jean-Damien decided to go with "precise".
      MarpaX::Languages::C::AST follows the C11 standard,
      with either GCC or Microsoft extensions.
      This has the advantage that
      MarpaX::Languages::C::AST could be used as the front end of a compiler.
    </p>
    <h3>Applications</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Customized and customize-able "lints" -- programs to enforce C language standards
        and restrictions specific to a individual, a company or a project.
      </li></ul>
    <h3>Compilers?</h3>
    <p>
      I am focused on parsing,
      and I'm often tempted to call MarpaX::Languages::C::AST a "compiler".
      And it can be called that if you were willing to consider an abstract syntax tree
      a compilation "target".
      But much of what you look for in a compiler is missing from MarpaX::Languages::C::AST,
      including implementation of non-syntactic constraints -- things
      like "<tt>case</tt>" labels only being allowed in switch statements.
      These could be added in the same way that more conventional compilers typically implement them --
      in post-processing.
      But a central advantage of MarpaX::Languages::C::AST is to empower your own extensions --
      for you to pick up where it leaves off.
