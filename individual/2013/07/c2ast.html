</center>
  <p>
      <!--

      -->
      Jean-Damien Durand has written a very ambitious application of Marpa:
      A tool which parses C language into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
      Recently released, it has been tested against
      Perl's C source code, as well as Marpa's own C source file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Potential uses of MarpaX::Languages::C::AST includes tools, interpreters
      and compilers for the C language.
      This code is open source, and is much easier basis on which
      to create C language supersets and subsets than
      previous C parsers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A C parser can take one of two strategies: approximate or precise.
      A compiler has, of course, to be precise.
      Tools, such as cross-referencers, often decide to be approximate, or sloppy.
      Sloppiness is easier to implement and has other advantages:
      Compilers require the user to get all the C flags right.
      A sloppy tool can tolerate missing flags: what the flags should be
      can be one of the things it guesses at.
    </p>
    <p>Of the two strategies, Jean-Damien decided to go with "precise".
      MarpaX::Languages::C::AST follows the C11 standard,
      with either GCC or Microsoft extensions.
      This has the advantage that
      MarpaX::Languages::C::AST could be used as the front end of a compiler.
    </p>
    <h3>A sample app: checking for violations of reserved namespace</h3>
    <p>To help check out MarpaX::Languges::C::AST, Jean-Damien created a tool which spots
      use of C reserved names.
      When many of the C language namespace decisions were made,
      namespace management was less well understood than it is now.
      Some of the restrictions are, frankly, annoying.
      Since standard diagnostics often do not report violations of them,
      reserved namespace violations are often ignored.
    (The namespace restrictions imposed by the basic C and POSIX C Libary standards are
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Reserved-Names.html">
        conveniently
        collected in GNU's manual for its libc library</a>).
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>Ignored or not, the issue is serious -- namespace violations in
    currenly working code could cause it to break when ported, or when its environment
    is upgraded.
      Consider, as an example, this reservation of namespace:
    </p><blockquote>Additional
      macro definitions, beginning with
      <b>E</b>
      and a digit or
      <b>E</b>
      and an uppercase
      letter, may also be specified by the implementation.
    </blockquote><p>
      Any implementation is free to define a new error code, say
      <tt>EIM</tt>
      for
      "Error you never IMagined would be defined".
      Whether or not an implementation defines
      <tt>EIM</tt>
      as an error code, the standards leave the result of an program's re-appropriation
      of it "undefined".
      In the C standards, "undefined" is used in a special way,
      and not a nice one.
      "Undefined" behaviors mean the implementation can break
      "break" in any way that it finds convenient, with or
      without notice.
      Using
      <tt>#undef</tt>
      is no help here.
      The result of an "<tt>#undef EIM</tt>" is also undefined.
    </p>
    <p>As an aside, the standards committee did not do this out of malevolence.
      They wanted to allow
      optimized implementations of
      elements in the reserved namespace.
      If a compiler that is allowed to assume
      that a programmer has not commandeered the reserved namespace for his own uses,
      it can be much more aggressive in its optimizations.
    </p>
    <p>I've been aware of these namespace issues for some time, but the list of this is
      long and complicated, and there are no diagnostics
      for violations of them.
      I suspected some has slipped into Marpa's 21,000 plus lines of C code.
      Some had.
    </p>
    <p>
      My implementation of Earley's algorithm requires many types and it is convenient to have short
      abbreviations for things like Earley items and Earley sets.
      <tt>EIM</tt>
      and
      <tt>ES</tt>
      seemed like great choices.
      But of course they violate the error code namespace.
      (I told you these restrictions could be annoying.)
    </p>
    <p>Also flagged as violations by Jean-Damien's utility were the variable names
      <tt>top_of_stack</tt>
      and
      <tt>token_type</tt>:
      "Function names that begin with either
      <tt>is</tt>
      or
      <tt>to</tt>,
      and a lowercase letter" are also reserved.
      That means that I had also transgressed by using
      <tt>isy_count</tt>
      and
      <tt>isy_by_right_isy_matrix</tt>.
      ("isy" is my short abbreviation for "internal symbol", and the last variable name shows why I need to use abbreviations --
      my types appear as part of other variables and they are far more readable with abbreviated type names.)
    </p>
    <p>How did the Perl 5.19.2 source fare?
      No better than Marpa's source, which appropriates these names from the reserved space:
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt>
      isa isa_changed isa_hash isa_hashes isarev isary ischop iscv isdst isg
      isio islop islv ismatchop ismodifying ismore isreg isrel isuni isutf
      todo toend token tokenbuf_len toketype tokid
      tolen too too_deep top top2 top_index top_ptr top_si topelem
      topgen_cmp topgv topmask topname
      topsv toptab tot total total_elems
    </tt></blockquote>
    <p>Another commonly misappropriated portion of the namespace reserved by the C standards is that beginning with "str",
    which is reserved for string functions by the implementation.
    This is far beyond what seems necessary, but so saith the standards,
    and Perl 5.19.2 intrudes on that namespace a few times:
    <blockquote><tt>
strbeg stream strend strict string stringarg stringok strp strpos strut
    </tt></blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p><p>And, in fact, Perl's namespace troubles get deeper than Marpa's.
      So far, the examples have only included names reserved regardless of header inclusion.
      Marpa's C code does not do IO, and it is safe to assume it never will, so Marpa is free
      to ignore, for example, the namespace reserved for
      <tt>fcntl.h</tt>.
      <tt>fnctl.h</tt>
      reserves, among other things, the namespace starting with
      <tt>S_</tt>,
      Perl has to take into account headers needed to do POSIX IO,
      but Perl also uses, for its own purposes, 353 variables named in the alphabetical range from
      <tt>S_aassign_common_vars</tt>
      to
      <tt>S_yywarn</tt>.
    </p>
    <h3>Applications</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Customized and customize-able "lints" -- programs to enforce C language standards
    and restrictions specific to a individual, a company or a project.
    <li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Compilers?</h3>
    <p>
    I am focused on parsing,
    and I'm often tempted to call MarpaX::Languages::C::AST a "compiler".
    And it can be called that if you were willing to consider an abstract syntax tree
    a compilation "target".
    But much of what you look for in a compiler is missing from MarpaX::Languages::C::AST,
    including implementation of non-syntactic constraints -- things
    like "<tt>case</tt>" labels only being allowed in switch statements.
    These could be added in the same way that more conventional compilers typically implement them --
    in post-processing.
    But a central advantage of MarpaX::Languages::C::AST is to empower your own extensions --
    for you to pick up where it leaves off.
