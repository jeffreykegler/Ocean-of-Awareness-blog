  <h3>Declarative and procedural parsing</h3>
    <p><!--
      marpa_r2_html_fmt --no-added-tag-comment --no-ws-ok-after-start-tag
-->A declarative parser
      takes a description of your language and parses it
      for you.
      On the face of it, this sounds like the way you'd want
      to go,
      and Marpa offers that possibily -- it generates
      a parser from anything you can write in BNF and,
      if the parser in is one of the classes currently in
      practical use,
      that parser will run in linear time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But practical grammars often have context-sensitive parts --
      features which cannot be described in BNF.
      Nice as declarative parsing may sound,
      the need to do at least
      <b>some</b>
      procedural parsing
      can seem to an obstacle
      in real-life.
      In this post, I take a problem for which procedural
      parsing is essential,
      and create a fast, short solution that
      mixes procedural and declarative.
    </p>
    <h3>The application</h3>
    <p>This is a sample of the language:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
A2(A2(S3(Hey)S13(Hello, World!))S5(Ciao!))
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It describes strings in nested arrays.
      The strings are introducted by the letter 'S', followed by a length count and then,
      in parentheses, the string itself.
      Arrays are introducted by the letter 'A' followed by an element count and, inside parentheses, the
      array's contents.
      These contents are a concatenated series of strings and other arrays.
      I call this a Dyck-Hollerith language because it
      combines
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollerith_constant">
        Hollerith constants</a>
      (strings preceded by a count),
      with balanced parentheses
      (what is called
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyck_language">
        a Dyck language</a>
      by mathematicians).
    </p>
    <p>
      The language is one I've dealt with before.
      It is apparently from "real life", and is described more fully
      in
      In
      <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/polettix/2012/04/parserecdescent-and-number-of-elements-read-on-the-fly.html">
        a blog post by
        Flavio Poletti</a>.
      Several people, Gabor Szabo among them, challenged me to show how
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Marpa-web-site/">
        Marpa</a>
      would do on this language.
      I did this a year ago, using Marpa's previous version, Marpa::XS.
      The result was quite satisfactory, but
      in this post, I redo it,
      The result, using Marpa's new SLIF interface,
      is a considerable improvement
      in readability, flexibility and speed.
    </p>
    <h3>The code</h3>
    <p>The full code for this example is in
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/jeffreykegler/5745272">
        a Github gist</a>.
      In what follows, I will assume the reader is
      interested in the ideas.
      Details,
      along with more detail-oriented tutorials,
      can be found
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2".
in Marpa's documentation</a>.
        Other tutorials are
        on
        <a href=http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/">
          the Ocean of Awareness blog</a>,
        and on
        <a href="http://marpa-guide.github.io/index.html">
          the Marpa Guide,
          a new website</a>
        being
        built due to the generosity of Peter Stuifzand
        and Ron Savage.
      </a></p>
    <h3>The DSL</h3>
    <p>First off, let's look at the declarative part.
      The core of the parser is the following lines,
      containing the BNF for the language's top-level structure.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
my $dsl = &lt;&lt;'END_OF_DSL';
# The BNF
:start ::= sentence
sentence ::= element
array ::= 'A' &lt;array count&gt; '(' elements ')'
    action =&gt; check_array
string ::= ( 'S' &lt;string length&gt; '(' ) text ( ')' )
elements ::= element+
  action =&gt; ::array
element ::= string | array
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Details of this syntax are in Marpa's documentation,
      but it's a dialect of EBNF.
      Adverbs like
      <tt>action =&gt; semantics</tt>
      tell Marpa what the semantics will be.
      The default (which will be set below) is for a rule to return its first child.
      The parentheses in the
      <tt>string</tt>
      declaration "hide" the symbols from the
      semantics, so that
      <tt>text</tt>
      is treated by the semantics as if it
      were the "first" symbol.
      <tt>::array</tt>
      semantics tell Marpa to return all every
      <tt>element</tt>
      of
      <tt>elements</tt>
      in an array.
      And
      <tt>check_array</tt>
      is the name of a function providing
      the semantics, as will be seen below.
    </p>
    <p>Marpa's SLIF provides a lexer for the user,
      and this Marpa-internal lexer will handle most
      of the symbols in this example.
      The single-quoted strings we saw in the BNF are actually instructions
      to the internal lexer.
      The next lines tell Marpa how to recognize
      the
      <tt>&lt;array_count&gt;</tt>
      and
      <tt>&lt;string length&gt;</tt>.
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;array count&gt; ~ [\d]+
&lt;string length&gt; ~ [\d]+
text ~ [\d\D]
END_OF_DSL
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <tt>&lt;array_count&gt;</tt>
      anand
      <tt>&lt;string length&gt;</tt>
      are both declared to be a series of digits.
      <tt>text</tt>
      is a stub.
      The length of
      <tt>text</tt>
      depends on the numeric value of
      <tt>&lt;string length&gt;</tt>, and dealing with that is beyond the power of
      the BNF.
      When it comes time to count out the symbols needed for
      <tt>text</tt>,
      we will hand control over to an external lexer.
      For the purposes of Marpa's lexer, it's enough to describe
      <tt>text</tt>
      as a single character of anything.
    </p>
    <p>Now comes the weld between declarative and procedural ...
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
:lexeme ~ &lt;string length&gt; pause =&gt; after
:lexeme ~ text pause =&gt; before
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These two statements tell Marpa that
      <tt>&lt;string length&gt;</tt>
      and
      <tt>&lt;text&gt;</tt>
      are two lexicals at which Marpa's own parsing should "pause",
      handing over control to external procedural logic.
      In the case of
      <tt>&lt;string length&gt;</tt>,
      the pause should be after it is read.
      In the case of
      <tt>&lt;text&gt;</tt>
      the pause should be before.
      What happens during the "pause", we will soon see.
    </p>
    <h3>Starting the parse</h3>
    <p>Next follows the code to read the DSL,
      and start the parser.
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
my $grammar = Marpa::R2::Scanless::G-&gt;new(
    {   action_object  =&gt; 'My_Actions',
        default_action =&gt; '::first',
        source         =&gt; \$dsl
    }
);

my $recce = Marpa::R2::Scanless::R-&gt;new( { grammar =&gt; $grammar } );
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The previous lines tell Marpa that, when its semantics
      are provided by a Perl closure, to look for that closure in a package called
      <tt>My_Actions</tt>.
      The default semantics are
      <tt>::first</tt>, which means simply pass the value of
      the first RHS symbol of a rule upwards.
    </p>
    <h3>The main loop</h3>
    <p>We saw our input above:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
$input = 'A2(A2(S3(Hey)S13(Hello, World!))S5(Ciao!))';
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The block of code which follows is the main loop through the parse, including
      all the procedural logic.
      Below, I will pull out this
      procedural logic out of the loop
      for separate examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the
      <tt>$recce-&gt;read()</tt>
      method performs the first read
      and sets up the input string.
      The interior of the loop is entered whenever Marpa "pauses".
      Once the procedural logic is done, Marpa resumes with
      the
      <tt>$recce-&gt;resume()</tt>
      call.
      Throughout
      <tt>$pos</tt>
      is used to track the current character
      in the input stream.
      The loop ends when
      the
      <tt>$pos</tt>
      is after the last character of
      <tt>$input</tt>.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
my $last_string_length;
my $input_length = length $input;
INPUT:
for (
    my $pos = $recce-&gt;read( \$input );
    $pos &lt; $input_length;
    $pos = $recce-&gt;resume($pos)
    )
{
    my $lexeme = $recce-&gt;pause_lexeme();
    die q{Parse exhausted in front of this string: "},
        substr( $input, $pos ), q{"}
        if not defined $lexeme;
    my ( $start, $lexeme_length ) = $recce-&gt;pause_span();
    if ( $lexeme eq 'string length' ) {
        $last_string_length = $recce-&gt;literal( $start, $lexeme_length ) + 0;
        $pos = $start + $lexeme_length;
        next INPUT;
    }
    if ( $lexeme eq 'text' ) {
        my $text_length = $last_string_length;
        $recce-&gt;lexeme_read( 'text', $start, $text_length );
        $pos = $start + $text_length;
        next INPUT;
    } ## end if ( $lexeme eq 'text' )
    die "Unexpected lexeme: $lexeme";
} ## end INPUT: for ( my $pos = $recce-&gt;read( \$input ); $pos &lt; $input_length...)
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>The procedural parsing</h3>
    <p>What the procedural logic needs to do is to count the
      <tt>text</tt>
      strings properly.
      The logic to do this is coded in a very direct way.
      First
      <tt>&lt;string length&gt;</tt>:
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
    if ( $lexeme eq 'string length' ) {
        $last_string_length = $recce-&gt;literal( $start, $lexeme_length ) + 0;
        $pos = $start + $lexeme_length;
        next INPUT;
    }
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Above, we used
      <tt>pause_span()</tt>
      to set
      <tt>$start</tt>
      and
      <tt>$lexeme_length</tt>
      to the start and length of the lexeme that
      Marpa's internal scanner found.
      Passed to
      <tt>$recce->&gtliteral()</tt>, these two values
      return the "literal" string value of the lexeme, which will
      be the ASCII representation of a decimal number.
      We convert it to numeric, salt it away in
      <tt>$last_string_length</tt>,
      and set
      <tt>$pos</tt>
      to the location just after the
      <tt>&lt;string length&gt;</tt>
      lexeme.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
    if ( $lexeme eq 'text' ) {
        my $text_length = $last_string_length;
        $recce-&gt;lexeme_read( 'text', $start, $text_length );
        $pos = $start + $text_length;
        next INPUT;
    } ## end if ( $lexeme eq 'text' )
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Now we come to counting out the characters for the
      <tt>text</tt>
      lexeme.
      Recall that in the case of
      <tt>text</tt>, we pause
      <b>before</b>
      the lexeme, which means it will not have been read yet.
      With
      <tt>$recce-&gtlexeme_read()</tt>, we tell Marpa
      what we want the next lexeme to be:
      of type
      <tt>text</tt>,
      starting as the already decided
      <tt>$start</tt>
      position,
      and with the length that
      we saved in
      <tt>$last_string_length</tt>.
      We also set
      <tt>$pos</tt>
      to be just after the
      end of the lexeme.
    </p>
    <p>We've focused on the string lengths, but the Dyck-Hollerith language has
      a count of the number of elements in its array.
      Marpa's BNF-driver parsing logic has no trouble
      determining this from the array contents themselves,
      so that the count is
      completely redundant.
      What to do with the
      <tt>&lt;array count&gt;</tt>?
      Here's one idea.
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
package My_Actions;
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
sub check_array {
    my ( undef, undef, $declared_size, undef, $array ) = @_;
    my $actual_size = @{$array};
    warn
        "Array size ($actual_size) does not match that specified ($declared_size)"
        if $declared_size != $actual_size;
    return $array;
} ## end sub check_array
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Recall that Marpa promised special semantics for the
      <tt>array</tt>
      rule
      in its DSL.
      Here they are.
      The first parameter to Marpa's semantic closures is a per-parse variable, here unused.
      The rest are the values of the RHS symbols, in order.
      We only care about the second (for
      <tt>&lt;array count&gt;</tt>),
      and the fourth (for
      <tt>elements</tt>).
      We determine a
      <tt>$declared_size</tt>
      from
      <tt>&lt;array count&gt;</tt>;
      an a
      <tt>$actual</tt>
      by looking at the array referenced by
      <tt>$array</tt>.
      If these differ, we choose to warn the user.
      Depending on your purposes,
      anything from ignoring the issue
      to throwing a fatal error may be equally or more reasonable.
    </p>
    <h3>The result of the the parse</h3>
    <p>And now we are ready to take the result of the parse.
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
my $result = $recce-&gt;value();
die 'No parse' if not defined $result;
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>For more about Marpa</h3>
    <p>The techniques described apply to problems considerably
      larger this than the example of this post.
      Jean-Damien Durand is using them to create
      <a href="https://github.com/jddurand/MarpaX-Languages-C-AST">
        a C-to-AST tool</a>.
      This
      takes C language and converts it to an AST,
      following the C11
      specification carefully.
      The AST can then be manipulated
      as you wish.
