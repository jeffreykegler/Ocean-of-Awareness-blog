      "First we ask, what impact will our algorithm have on the parsing
      done in production compilers for existing programming languages?
      The answer is, practically none." -- Jay Earley's Ph.D thesis, p. 122.
  </blockquote>
    </p>In the above quote, the inventor of Earley's algorithm poses a question
    about it.  Is it fast enough for a production compiler?  His answer is a
    stark "no".
    <p>Earley goes on to note that hand-written parsers can clearly be faster.
    At the time Earley wrote, this was the state of the art for production compilers and
    the world was such that languages remained static and hand-written approaches were
    reasonable.
    Today, hand-written parsers are once again the state of the art for production compilers,
    though expectations about the size and stabiity of languages,
    and perceptions about the desirability of large amounts of complex hand-crafted code,
    has changed considerably.
    But the speed remains the obstacle to anything better.  Or does it?
    </p>
    <p>Earley, writing in 1968, took it for granted that a hand-written parser
    was a highly optimized parser.  Four and a half decades of practice have taught
    us that in fact it is hard to keep complex hand-written parsers correct
    for evolving languages, and that they are in fact often slow.
    But let's assume we don't know that.
    </p>
    Let's assume the competitors to Earley's are one hundred times as fast.
    So, slower by a factor of hundred means too slow, right?
    Wrong.
    The tendency is to repeat clear verdicts,
    rather than re-examine them,
    particularly if the field is complex.
    And parsing theory is not just complex.
    but it's out of fashion and off the funding radar.
    Which means nobody has thought about the relevance of Moore's Law.
    <h3>Time complexity and speed</h3>
    <p>Before re-examining the Earley verdict,
    I'd like to clarify the difference between time complexity and speed.
    Speed is fairly simple.
    It's how fast the algorithm is.
    To make speeds comparable, we'll assume we can count weighted instrucions
    in a sensible way on some mutually-agreed architecture.
    <p>
    By the time Earley was writing, programmers had discovered that simply comparing
    speeds would not work.
    Computers were improving so quickly that the significance of speed results
    could vanish quickly.
    To make statements about time efficiency that would remain true,
    they created the idea of time complexity.
    </p>
    <p>Time complexity is measured using several notations, but the most
    common is big-O notation.
    Assume algorithm A uses 42 weighted instructions for each input symbol.
    Assume that algorithm B uses 1792 weighted instructions for each input symbol.
    Where the count of input symbols is N,
    A's speed is 42*N, and B's is 1792*N.
    But the time complexity of both is O(N) -- the big-O notation throws
    away the "constant factor".
    </p>
    <p>It often happens that algorithms we need to compare for time efficiency
    have the same time complexity,
    but differents speeds.
    And it sometimes happens that this difference is relevant.
    When this happens, the slower algorithm is accused of having
    a "high constant factor".
    <h3>OK, now about that constant factor</h3>
    </p>

      Marpa's latest version is
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2">Marpa::R2,
        which is available on CPAN</a>.
      Marpa's
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-2.052000/pod/Scanless/DSL.pod">SLIF
        is
        a new interface</a>,
      which represents a major increase
      in Marpa's "whipitupitude".
      The SLIF has tutorials
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/01/dsl_simpler2.html">here

      Marpa has
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Marpa-web-site/">a web page</a>,

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
