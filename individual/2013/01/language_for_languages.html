      Scanless interface</a>
      is not yet two weeks old,
      but already there are completed applications.
      Significantly, two of them are for work.
      <h3>A JSON Parser</h3>
      <p>The non work-related application is a JSON parser.
      Given what it does,
      it easily could have been work-related.
      And given it's been available for a few days as a gist,
      it may well be in production use somewhere.
      It was written by Peter Stuifzand,
      runs 185 lines
      and took him less than 30 minutes to write.
      Peter reports that it was a matter of
      typing in the grammar,
      and adding a few Perl functions to provide the semantics.
      <p>
      There are, of course, other JSON parsers out there,
      many of which run faster.
      These, however, took weeks to write.
      If you are, for example,
      thinking of
      <a href="http://bolinfest.com/essays/json.html">
      extending JSON</a>,
      and development time is a major consideration,
      the Marpa-based solution will be attractive.
      <h3>Printer escape codes</h3>
      Peter also did
      <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/marpa-parser/n4ouLW0e6P8/vdrku9fczZEJ">
      a Marpa-based language for work</a> --
      a solution to the problem of printer escape codes.
      For those unfamilar, a printer's special features can often be invoked
      by "escape sequences" --
      byte sequences which control things like cursor motion, color, character sets,
      graphics, etc., etc.
      These can get quite fancy, but are usually very repetitive, and it's nice
      to wrap them in conveniently named functions.
      <p>Escape sequences can get quite fancy, but they're usually repetitive,
      and even when complex typically aren't very interesting.
      They can be programmed with regex or eval hacks,
      but Peter chose Marpa-based grammar-driven programming because he thought it
      would be faster.
      His program compiles from
      a mini-language that specifies 
      escape sequences to Perl.
      He was done in a hour.
      <h3>A log file query language</h3>
      <p>The most adventurous language of the three comes from
      the other side of the Atlantic, where Paul Bennett
      was faced with analyzing lots of nginx log files.
      Both of Peter's languages were already
      fully designed and formally specified.
      Paul designed his own language from scratch.
      Peter had written Marpa-based languages prior to my release
      of the Scanless interface, so his times I have to assume include
      no learning curve.
      Paul apparently was able to teach himself to use Marpa's Scanless
      interface starting from a gist.
      (He doesn't say, but it could have been the one for
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/01/dsl_simpler2.html">
      this post</a>.)
      <p>Paul took a similar approach to the one Peter used for
      printer escapes -- his log query language compiles to Perl.
      Its writing and debugging
      spread out over 3 days that sound
      like they included a lot of log file analysis.
      <p>
      Paul reports that his language is on the job already,
      but that
      needs some clean-up before going in CPAN.
      I look forward to seeing it
      -- the snippets he shows seem to include 
      strings, integers and timestamps as supported types;
      regexes;
      adn the standard comparision and boolean operators,
      plus "any", "between" and "one" operators.
      Pretty good for 3 days.
      Perhaps a lot of nasty problems snuggled away
      in log files may soon find their
      hiding places not nearly as safe 
      as they've come to expect.

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
