    <p>In 1980, George Copeland wrote
      <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=802685">
    an article</a>
    titled "What if Mass Storage were Free?".
      Costs of mass storage were showing signs
      that they might fall dramatically.
      Copeland, as a thought exercise, took this trend to its extreme.
      Among other things, he predicted that deletion would become
      unnecessary, and in fact, undesirable.
    </p>
    <p>Copeland's
      thought experiment has proved prophetic.
      For many purposes, mass storage is treated as if it were free.
      For example, you probably retrieved this blog post from a server
      provided to me at no charge, in the hope
      that I might write and upload something interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until now languages were high-cost efforts.
      Worse, language projects ran a high risk of disappointment,
      up to and including total failure.
      I believe those days are coming to an end.
    </p>
    <h3>Small languages, shaped to the problem domain</h3>
    <p>What if whenever you needed a new language, poof, it was there?
      You would be encouraged to tackle each problem domain with
      a new language dedicated to dealing with that domain.
      Since each language is no larger than its problem domain,
      learning a language would be essentially the same as learning
      the problem domain.
      The incremental effort required to learn the language
      itself would head toward zero.
    </p>
    <h3>No more language bloat</h3>
    <p>Language bloat would end.
      Currently, the risk and cost of developing languages
      make it imperative to extend the ones we have.
      Free languages mean fewer reasons to add features
      to existing languages.
    </p>
    <h3>No more search for THE perfect language</h3>
    <p>
      No language is perfect for all tasks.
      But because the high cost of languages favors
      large, general-purpose languages,
      we are compelled to try for perfection anyway.
      Ironically, we are often making the language worse,
      and we know it.
    </p>
    <h3>A world full of perfect languages</h3>
    <p>An older sense of the word perfect is
      "having all the properties or qualities requisite to its nature and kind".
      The C language might be called perfect in this sense.
      C lacks a lot of features that are highly desirable in most contexts.
      But for programming that is portable
      and close to the hardware,
      the C language is perfect or close to it.
      If languages were free, this is the kind of perfection
      that we would seek --
      languages precisely fitted to their domain,
      so that adding to them cannot make them better.
    </p>
    <h3>Moving toward free</h3>
    <p>
      My own effort to contribute to 
      a fall in the cost of languages is the Marpa parser.
      Marpa produces a reasonable parser
      for every language you can write in BNF.
      If the BNF is for a grammar in any of the classes currently in practical
      use, the parser Marpa produces will have linear speed.
      In one case, using Marpa,
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/4447349">a targeted language</a>
      was written
      in less than an hour.
      <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/2013/01/a-language-for-writing-languages.html">
        More typically</a>, Marpa reduce the time needed to create new languages to hours.
    </p>
    <p>As one example of going from "impossible" to "easy",
      I have written a drop-in solution to an example in the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Gang
        of Four book</a>.
      The Gang of Four described a language
      and its interpretation,
      but they did not include a parser.
      Creating a parser
      to fit their example would have been
      impossibly hard when the Gang of Four wrote.
      Using Marpa, it is easy.
      The parser can be found in
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/03/bnf_to_ast.html">this
        earlier blog post</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marpa's latest version is
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2">Marpa::R2,
        which is available on CPAN</a>.
      Recently, it has gained immensely in "whipitupitude" with
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-2.048000/pod/Scanless/DSL.pod">
        a new interface</a>,
      which has tutorials
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/01/dsl_simpler2.html">here
      </a>
      and
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/01/announce_scanless.html">
        here</a>.
      Marpa has
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Marpa-web-site/">a web page</a>,
      and of course it is the focus of
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/">
        my "Ocean of Awareness" blog</a>.

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
