      Seasoned and candid observers of the parsing scene may not
      have been impressed by this series of posts about my new Marpa parser.
      They've certainly seen it before.
      "New" parsing algorithms have come along over the past decades with
      some regularity.
      They tried a wide variety of different approaches,
      but all of them shared two things: confident authors
      and disappointing results.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this post I'll explain, on what my confidence in Marpa is based,
      and why I think that even a jaded observer might want to say,
      "This time it might be different".
    </p>
    <h3>The power and flexibility of table parsing</h3>
    <p>
      Marpa is a table parser, one of a family of such algorithms.
      Marpa is unusual among this family in its focus on speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Table parsing means parsing by constructing a table of all the possible parses.
      The current favorite parsers (yacc, recursive descent, etc.) do not do this --
      their quest for speed uses state diagrams and/or stacks,
      and they are not able to track all possible parses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advantages of table parsing are pretty obvious.
      If your table tracks BNF rules,
      you can parse any grammar that you can write in BNF.
      You always know exactly what is going on -- what rules
      are possible, what rules have been recognized,
      how far into a rule you have recognized it,
      what symbols you expect next, etc. etc.
      This means that if build the table steadily from left to right
      (which Marpa does)
      you can easily combine procedural parsing with your parsing algorithm.
      And you can pinpoint and identify errors precisely.
    </p>
    <h3>The feasibility of table parsing</h3>
    <p>But a question arises about table parsing:
      "Sounds great, but can you do it fast enough to be useful in practice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      First, let's assure ourselves that it can be done.
      If we ignore speed issues,
      the answer is fairly clearly "yes".
      A grammar has a finite number of rules, each of finite length,
      and parses a finite number of input symbols.
      Since the number of input symbols is finite,
      at any location the number of previous location at which a rule
      or symbol could have started is also finite.
      Since everything is finite, all we have to do is check all the possibilities
      as we progress from left-to-right, making sure they apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      So table parsing is definitely possible.
      But way of implementing it described above would be too slow for it
      to be a practical method.
    Fortunately, there are faster ways to do it,
      and a number of these are in use.
      But most of them concentrate on power -- they don't try to
      be fast enough for a wide range of practical applications,
      and they aren't.
    </p>

        which is available on CPAN</a>.

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
