      In the Perl world at this moment,
      a lot is being said about the consequences of bad design.
      And it is useful to study design failures.
      But the exercise will come to nothing
      without a road to good design.
      This post will point out four
      Perl-centric
      projects that
      are worth study as models
      of good design.
    </p>
    <p>
      The projects are
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/ack">
      ack</a>,
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/App-cpanminus">
      cpanm</a>,
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/local-lib">local::lib</a> and
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/App-perlbrew">perlbrew</a>.
      Each of these is perfect
      in the older sense of "having all that is requisite to its nature and kind"
      (<a href="http://1828.mshaffer.com/d/word/perfect">Webster's 1828</a>).
	If you are into Perl,
	they are all widely useful,
	and looking at them as a potential or an actual user
	is the best way to gain an appreciation of the art behind them.
    </p>
    <p><tt>ack</tt> is a file search tool -- UNIX's grep with improvements.
      The improvements are influenced by a Perl sensibility,
      and <tt>ack</tt> is written in Perl.
      But while the other tools I list are of little interest unless
      you are into Perl,
      <tt>ack</tt> can help you out even if you otherwise shun Perl tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      <tt>cpanm</tt> is for installing CPAN packages from CPAN.
      If you don't know what that means, you aren't interested.
      If you do, you want to be using it.
      It does everything you need and importantly, nothing more.
      The interface is without clutter.
      Like I said, perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <tt>local::lib</tt> is for installing Perl modules in the directory of your choice.
      Even if you have root permission on a system,
      it is good practice to leave the delivered Perl on your system
      untouched except by vendor-sponsored patches and updates.
      <tt>local::lib</tt> allows you to do this easily and conveniently.
      It has every feature and convenience I want.
      And reading its documentation is again an encounter with
      perfection.
      Every feature described is
      <ul>
      <li>something that you need today,
      <li>something that you are worried you might need tomorrow, or
      <li>something that you are not worried you might need,
      but on reading the documentation will discover that you should be.
      </ul>
      Aside from that, there is nothing else.
      Clutter-free.  Perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repeated perfection can be boring,
      a fact which
      I suspect plays no small role
      in making perfection an unusual thing in this world.
      So of <tt>perlbrew</tt>,
      I will simply say that it does for Perl versions and executables
      what <tt>local::lib</tt> does for Perl modules.
      <tt>perlbrew</tt> is the way to manage alternative Perl executables.
      And using <tt>perlbrew</tt>
      is a good way to study yet another perfect interface.
    </p>
    <p>
    How much relevance does the work of
      Andy Lester (<tt>ack</tt>),
      Tatsuhiko Miyagawa (<tt>cpanm</tt>),
      Matt S Trout (<tt>local::lib</tt>)
      and Kang-min Liu (<tt>perlbrew</tt>) have to other projects,
      including projects that now seem larger and more complex?
      Certainly
      these four applications all seem simple, well-defined,
      and self-contained.
      But I would argue that,
      if these problems seem simple and well-defined today,
      much of that impression is the result of the design skills
      of Andy, Tatsuhiko, Matt and Kang-min.
      And if, to an extent, they did benefit from
      having the good fortune to pick the the right problem at
      the right time,
      it is useful to recall
      Ben Hogan's comment on his profession:
    </p>
    <blockquote>Golf is a game of luck.
      The more I practice, the luckier I get.
    </blockquote>
