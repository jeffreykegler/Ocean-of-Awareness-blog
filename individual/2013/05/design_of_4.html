      In the Perl world at the moment,
      a lot is being said about the consequences of bad design.
      And it is useful to study design failures.
      But the exercise will come to nothing unless you
      also find some road to learning good design.
      This post will point out four
      Perl-centric
      projects which I believe exemplify good design,
      to the extent they are worth study as models
      for other projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The projects are
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/ack">
      ack</a>,
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/App-cpanminus">
      cpanm</a>,
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/local-lib">local::lib</a> and
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/App-perlbrew">perlbrew</a>.
      Each of these is perfect
      in the older sense of "having all that is requisite to its nature and kind"
      (<a href="http://1828.mshaffer.com/d/word/perfect">Webster's 1828</a>).
	If you are into Perl,
	they are all widely useful,
	and looking at them as a potential or an actual user
	is the best way to gain an appreciation of the art behind them.
    </p>
    <p><tt>ack</tt> is a file search tool -- UNIX's grep with improvements.
      The improvements are influenced by a Perl sensibility,
      and <tt>ack</tt> is written in Perl.
      But while the other tools I list are little interest unless
      you are into Perl,
      <tt>ack</tt> can help you out even if you otherwise shun Perl tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      <tt>cpanm</tt> is for installing CPAN packages from CPAN.
      If you don't know what that means, you aren't interested.
      If you do, you want to be using it.
      It does everything you need and importantly, nothing more.
      The interface is without clutter.
      Like I said, perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <tt>local::lib</tt> is for installing Perl modules in the directory of your choice.
      Even if you have root permission on a system,
      it is good practice to leave the delivered Perl on your system
      untouched except by vendor-sponsored patches and updates.
      Leaving the system Perl untouched is wise, even if your system is single-user.
      On my Raspberry Pi, for example, it is almost certain that anyone
      will ever log in except for me.
      But I leave the Raspbian Perl as delivered.
      <tt>local::lib</tt> allows me to do this easily and conveniently.
      It has every feature and convenience I want.
      And reading its documentation is again an encounter with
      perfection.
      Every feature described is either something that you need today,
      something that you are worried you might need tomorrow,
      or something that you are not worried you might need,
      but on reading the documentation discover that you should be.
      Aside from that, there is nothing else.
      Clutter-free.  Perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repeated perfection can be boring,
      a fact which
      I suspect plays no small role
      in making perfection an unusual thing in this world.
      So of <tt>perlbrew</tt>,
      I will simply say that it does for Perl versions and executables
      what <tt>local::lib</tt> does for Perl modules.
      Good practice dictates that you leave the Perl delivered with
      your distribution alone.
      <tt>perlbrew</tt> is the way to manage alternative Perl executables.
      And using <tt>perlbrew</tt>
      is a good way to study yet another perfect interface.
    </p>
    <p>
    How much relevance does the work of
      Andy Lester (<tt>ack</tt>),
      Tatsuhiko Miyagawa (<tt>cpanm</tt>),
      Matt S Trout (<tt>local::lib</tt>)
      and Kang-min Liu (<tt>perlbrew</tt>) have to other projects,
      including projects that now seem larger and more complex?
      Certainly
      these four applications all seem simple, well-defined,
      and self-contained.
      But I would argue that
      much of the reason these problems seem simple and well-defined today,
      is the product of the design skills
      of Andy, Tatsuhiko, Matt and Kang-min.
      And if, to an extent, they did benefit from
      having the good fortune to pick the the right problem at
      the right time,
      I remmember Ben Hogan's comment on his profession:
    </p>
    <blockquote>Golf is a game of luck.
      The more I practice, the luckier I get.
    </blockquote>

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
