</center>
<p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-0.200000/">Marpa</a>
is now at 0.200000.
Following a standard rhetoric of version numbers, this indicates
that it's an official release and a major step forward,
but still alpha.
Marpa is a general BNF parser generator -- it parses from any grammar that
you can write in BNF.
It's based on Earley's algorithm, but incorporates recent advances,
so that it runs in linear time for all those grammars parseable by yacc
or recursive descent.

<p>The big news with Marpa 0.200000 is Marpa's 3rd generation evaluator.
The previous version of Marpa had two evaluators
-- one fast, but only
good for producing a single parse result,
the other capable of dealing with ambiguous grammars, but slower.
The 3rd generation has a single evaluator which combines the best
of both.
Not the least advantage of this change
is that it simplifies the documentation
and the interface.

<p>Marpa remains alpha and its interface may change.
But I use Marpa in my own work -- it's the basis 
of
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">
some rather handly HTML utilities</a>,
if I do say so myself.
But I would not at this point consider Marpa for anything
mission-critical or "production".

<p>An obsolete predecessor of Marpa, Parse::Marpa, is still on CPAN.
I plan to remove Parse::Marpa from CPAN shortly.
Anyone for whom that is a problem, please let me know.
Remember, the heroes of old will feast forever in Valhalla,
and Parse::Marpa will live eternally in
<a href="http://backpan.perl.org/">backpan</a>.

<p>As for the future:
The major barrier between Marpa and world conquest is speed.
I am busily converting Marpa to XS.

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
Also,
I will continue to dual-post for some time,
and have not yet frozen comments on the versions of the
post at
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>.
