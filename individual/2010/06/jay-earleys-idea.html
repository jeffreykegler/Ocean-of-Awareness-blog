</center>
<h2>Truth == Simplicity?</h2>

<p>In other posts,
I talked about improvements to Jay Earley's parsing algorithm
-- some from Joop Leo, some from Aycock and Horspool,
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">some of mine
</a>.
Here I'd like to talk about Jay Earley's original algorithm.
A common belief of great scientists is that,
if an idea is basic and true,
it is in essence also simple,
and therefore it must have a simple explanation.
</p>
<p>
Finding the simple explanation might be far from simple.
But a simple explanation there ought to be.
I like to look for those simple explanations.
Writing my mathematical novel, <i>The God Proof</i>,
confirmed
me in this habit.
Whenever I am studying something,
and it seems important and true,
I look for the simple explanation.
</p>

<h2>Dotted Rules</h2>

<p>
The idea behind Earley's algorithm is that you can
parse by building a table of rules
and where you are in those rules.
"Where" means two things: location in the rule relative to the rule's
symbols,
and location relative to the parse's input stream.
</p>
<p>
Let's look at an example of a rule in a context-free grammar.
Here's the rule for assignment in perl's
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y
</a>:
<pre><code class="prettyprint">
    termbinop => term ASSIGNOP term
</code></pre>
In parsing this rule, we can be at the beginning, before all of the symbols.
We can also be immediately after any of the three symbols.
That's a total of four possible locations.

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
Also,
I will continue to dual-post for some time,
and have not yet frozen comments on the versions of the
post at
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>.
