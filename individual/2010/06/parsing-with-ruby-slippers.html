<h2>PPI, perly.y and Marpa</h2>

<p>Recently I've been combining the two main approaches to
parsing Perl. 
One of these is the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/">PPI</a>
module.
The other is the parser in the actual
Perl distribution.
This is usually what is meant when
someone speaks simply of
"the Perl parser".
That
can be confusing
in this context,
so I will call the parser in the distribution,
the Traditional Perl Parser (TPP).

<p>I used the grammar in the TPP
(it's in
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>).
But I threw out TPP's lexer
(<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/toke.c">toke.c</a>).
I replaced
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/toke.c">toke.c</a>
with
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/lib/PPI/Tokenizer.pm">PPI::Tokenizer</a>,
rewrote TPP's bison grammar to use
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
and put the two together.

<p>To my surprise, mating the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/lib/PPI/Tokenizer.pm">PPI::Tokenizer</a>
and 
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>
has proved almost easy.
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/">PPI</a>
preserves whitespace and the TPP does not,
so I had to throw whitespace away.
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/">PPI</a>
combines some tokens that TPP separates.
(Notably
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/">PPI</a>
often combines sigils with other things.
The TPP never does.)
Also, there was the slightly more complicated issue of the ghostly semicolons,
which I'll deal with in a bit.

<p>I've gotten this combination working
on the Perl subset that
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Dumper/">Data::Dumper</a>
produces as output,
and it passes an appropriately selected dozen of
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Dumper/">Data::Dumper</a>'s
own test cases.
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Dumper/">Data::Dumper</a>
uses only part of Perl's semantics,
and that allows me to avoid
most of Perl's semantics.
Not that the semantics in
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Dumper/">Data::Dumper</a>'s
output are trivial.
They include a lot
of the logic of Perl expressions,
and the test cases get into some very serious nested dereferencing of lvalues.

<p>I don't ever intend to reimplement all (or even most)
of Perl's <b>semantics</b>.
Tricky lvalue indirections or not,
what I've done is a toy
in comparison with the Perl semantics,
and it will stay that way.
But I do think it possible to use
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
to reimplement
most of Perl's <b>grammar</b>.
An application could then plug its own semantics into it.

<p>I've adhered to the structure of
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>'s
grammar.
My intent is that this adaptation of
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>'s
grammar to
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
will work for cases much broader than
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Dumper/">Data::Dumper</a>
output.
As this project progresses,
I expect to be forced to confront a lot of interesting issues in
Perl's grammar.

<h2>The Case of the Ghostly Semicolons</h2>

<p>
But for the moment, let's get back to interfacing
the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/">PPI</a>
lexer to <a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>'s grammar,
and what turned out to be relatively simple issues.
For reasons which probably have to do with the limits of its underlying LALR algorithm,
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>
wants all expressions inside hash
brackets to end in semicolons.
That is, instead of 
<pre>
<tt>$p->{ func() }</tt>
</pre>
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a> needs to see
<pre>
<tt>$p->{ func(); }</tt>
</pre>
In actual Perl code that semicolon causes a syntax error.
But
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>
not only allows the semicolon --
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>
requires it.
These semicolons are only allowed to exist
as momentary "ghosts" inside the TPP,
where they flit from
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/toke.c">toke.c</a>
to
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>.

When exactly are ghost semicolons required?
Beats me.
The
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/toke.c">toke.c</a>
code for
handling curly braces is as convoluted as anything I've ever seen,
and I don't know of any documentation for it -- certainly the
comments do no more than hint at what's going on.

<p>Now, you'd think to mate
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/lib/PPI/">PPI</a>,
and
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>
I would need to figure out exactly when to insert "ghost" semicolons and when not.
I'd have to then implement this, ending up
with something that looks a lot like (shudder)
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/toke.c">toke.c</a>
rewritten in Perl.
But I don't have to do any of this.
You see, I've got Ruby Slippers.

<h2>Stepping Out with the Ruby Slippers</h2>

As most readers will recall, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_slippers">
Ruby Slippers
</a>
are Dorothy's shoes
in the movie <i>Wizard of Oz</i>, and they grant wishes.
In particular, Dorothy wants to get back to Kansas,
and she discovers that,
so long as she keeps the Ruby Slippers away from wicked witches,
all she has to do is wish she
is back in Kansas and she is there.

<p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>'s
parse engine has the very nice property that at every
point Marpa knows
exactly what parses are possible,
and it knows this information in a form
that it can share with the lexer.
This ability is a by-product of my rewrite of the Earley parse engine,
and has been useful beyond my expectations.
Here's how I deal with the ghostly semicolons.

<p><b>Step 1</b>:
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
has an "interactive" parse mode --
interactive in the sense that the parser and lexer interact.
What I do is just take the closing curly brace as I get it from
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/lib/PPI/Tokenizer.pm">PPI::Tokenizer</a>
and pass it on to the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
implementation of the <a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a> grammar.
In cases where an "un-semi-coloned" closing curly is acceptable, 
that's the end of the story.

<p><b>Step 2</b>:
But what if
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa
</a>/<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y
</a>
needs the semi-colon?
In interactive mode, when the parser is not happy with an
input, it stops, marking the point in the token stream
where it failed.
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
also makes available a list of tokens 
which <b>are</b> acceptable.

<p><b>Step 3</b>:
Here's where
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>'s
version of Ruby Slippers comes in.
All the application/tokenizer has to do is
pick a token which the parser <b>does</b> want,
dummy up the input so that the wanted token is the next token,
and restart the parse.
Poof, you're in Kansas.

<p>The Ruby Slippers method is quite remarkable.
In many practical cases, there is only one acceptable token.
In those cases, the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
parser tells the lexer exactly
how to make a grammar work as it goes along,
on a case by case basis.

<p>Issues with Ruby Slippers parsing can arise.
Sometimes there is
more than one acceptable token.
In those cases,
you rank your choices,
use lookahead,
look at
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>'s
ambiguous parsing capabilities, etc., etc.
Also, in some situations it may be important that all illegal parses
fail -- liberal acceptance of input is not always what is wanted.
You might need to be fascist,
rejecting everything which is not in exactly correct format.
Fascists need to be careful with their Ruby Slippers.

<h2>The Ruby Slippers Strike Again</h2>

<p>A more complex example of Ruby Slippers parsing
(and a pretty nifty one if I say so myself)
is in
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>.
This is
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
adapted to parse HTML is a very liberal way.
You can feed any file to
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
and get an HTML parse for it.
If the file is pathological HTML, or not HTML at all,
the HTML parse will be pathological,
but there <b>will</b> be an HTML parse.
(This is not totally crazy.
Most renderers accept any text whatsoever,
doing their best to render it on the screen as HTML.)

<p>As part of being very liberal,
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
supplies missing end tags, even end tags which are required
under the standards.
For traditional parsing methods,
this is a devilishly complex problem.
Try writing BNF that allows for missing end tags when possible.
Actually, just try defining "when possible".
I think you'll see it's very, very hard.

<p>But to solve this problem of end tags with
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
I don't need to
work out BNF or even define that slippery phrase
"when possible".
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
supplies missing end tags using the Ruby Slippers method.

<p>It's basically the same trick as before.
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
sets
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
to parse in interactive mode.
Then it simply feeds the tags it has to
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>,
as is,
and waits for
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
to have a problem.

When
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
can't use a token,
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
stops.
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
tells the tokenizer which token it could not use,
and which tokens it <b>could</b> use instead -- its list of "expected" tokens.

<p>The
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
tokenizer looks in the expected tokens.
Is there an end tag in there?
If so, it dummies
up a token for that end tag, sticks it in the input
stream, and restarts.

<p>Are there complications?
If
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
were parsing strict HTML, there wouldn't be.
For strict HTML,
whenever there is a missing end tag,
there will be only
one missing end tag.
In the strict HTML case,
the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
parser can always tell the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
exactly the right fix for any missing end tag.

<p>If you want to parse liberalized and defective HTML,
which
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
does,
things are more complex.
In some cases the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
parser suggests more than one 
way to dummy up the input --
more than one pair of Ruby Slippers, so to speak.
In these cases
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
has to decide "which shoes to wear."
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
uses a handful of simple
rules and heuristics.
The rules provide the right answer where there is one.
If it comes down to guessing at the intent,
the heuristics make good suggestions.

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p>On this project,
obvious thanks are due to Larry Wall
and the other authors for
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>
and
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/toke.c">toke.c</a>.
as well as to Adam Kennedy for
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/">PPI</a>.
Not so obvious might be my debt to Randal Schwartz, whose
<a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/col29.html">
Oct 2001
Linux Magazine column</a>
suggested the idea of using
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Dumper/">Data::Dumper</a>
output (and its test cases) to create
an initial subset for a Perl parser.
