<center><a name="marpa-is-now-on-for-right-recursions"> <h2>Marpa is now O(n) for Right Recursions</h2> </a>
</center>
<p>There's news with the latest version of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-0.102000/">Marpa (0.102000)</a>.
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-0.102000/">Marpa</a> now parses grammars with right-recursions in linear time (O(n)).
(<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-0.102000/">Marpa</a> already
handled left-recursion in linear time.)

<p>This means that <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-0.102000/">Marpa</a> is now O(n) for all LR-regular grammars.
LR-regular means LR with infinite lookahead using regular expressions.
That a big class of grammars.  It obviously includes all the LR(k) grammars,
and therefore everything parsed by Yapp, yacc, and bison.
LR-regular grammars also include
everything parseable by recursive descent, PEGs,
and other LL(k) grammars.
LR-regular definitely includes all regular expressions.

<p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-0.102000/">Marpa</a>'s O(n) behavior has another nice feature.
When it does <b>not</b> parse in O(n) time, it still parses.
Some parser generators always parse quickly, because when they
can't parse quickly, they don't parse at all.
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-0.102000/">Marpa</a> will parse anything you can write in BNF,
even highly ambiguous grammars,
and the absolute worst case is cubic (O(n**3)).

<p>In my last post, I explained that the previous release of
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-0.102000/">Marpa</a> could parse unusually 
large classes of grammars in linear time,
and that the right recursive cases where <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-0.102000/">Marpa</a> was not linear could
usually be worked around.
In fact, my experience had been that working around a right recursion was
easy, so I'd never bothered looking hard at the issue.

<p>Sometimes, writing a long explanation of why a limitation does
not matter makes me think:
Perhaps it does matter enough to take
a second look.  And take a second look is what I did.

<p>A 1991 article by Joop Leo had laid out a modification to Earley's
algorithm (the basis of Marpa) which was O(n) for all LR-regular
grammars.  Problem was, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-0.102000/">Marpa</a> already incorporated other, major,
enhancements to Earley's from another article, <a href="http://www.cs.uvic.ca/~nigelh/Publications/PracticalEarleyParsing.pdf">this one by Aycock
and Horspool and dating to 2002</a>.
Were the two modifications compatible?

<p>They are.  And <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-0.102000/">Marpa 0.102000</a> is the result.  CPAN and the Perl
community has it,
and everybody else will have it
when they borrow from us.

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
Also,
I will continue to dual-post for some time,
and have not yet frozen comments on the versions of the
post at
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>.
