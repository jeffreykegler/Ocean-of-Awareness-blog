</center>
<h2>The Garden Path</h2>

<p>In Perl 5.10, the following code is a syntax error:
<pre><code class="prettyprint">{42;{1,2,3;4}}
</code></pre>
If you try it,
what you'll see 
is something like this:
<pre><code class="prettyprint">syntax error at (eval 25) line 1, near ";4"
syntax error at (eval 25) line 1, near "}}
</code></pre>

<p>TPP is based on an algorithm called LALR.
(To avoid confusion when discussing various programs which parse Perl,
I will call the one that comes with the Perl distribution
the Tradition Perl Parser, or TPP.)
If you look at 
<kbd>perly.y</kbd>,
you will find a real achievement
in LALR parsing.
and therefore in computer language parsing in general.
But LALR has its limits and even in the TPP
these show up every now and then.

<p>Let's call our first example the Garden Path Code Block.
What is happening here?
Perl is being taken
"down the garden path" between the inner set of
curly braces.
TPP starts out down the path and, based on what it sees,
decides that it is parsing an anonymous hash.
TPP commits to that choice and then trainwrecks on the semicolon.
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/">PPI</a>
does no better.
PPI recognizes the Garden Path Code Block, but it parses it
as an anonymous hash, which is wrong.

<p>I am prototyping a new Perl syntax analyzer using
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>,
my new parser.
Marpa parses anything you can write in BNF, using ideas based on those
by Jay Earley.
Marpa::Perl is still a prototype,
but it has no difficulty in
recognizing the Garden Path Code Block as a code block.

<p>LALR's problem is that it is based on a state machine.
LALR's state machine ran at speeds and used memory
in keeping with the computer technology of 1969, which is
when LALR was invented.
But the LALR state machine needs to make decisions based
on limited context.
When the LALR parser in
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>
sees that semicolon, it is pretty much game over.

<p>LALR has always been
a tight squeeze
for the grammars of practical programming languages.
This is despite the fact that LALR has had decades to
condition 
language designers to accept its idea of what
"practical" means in a programming language.

<p>For Marpa, the Garden Path Code Block is not
even a serious challenge.
Marpa is based on Jay Earley's ideas.
These were the subject of 
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/2010/06/jay-earleys-idea.html">my last post</a>. 
Briefly, the core idea is to create a table of "Earley items".
Earley items are short records indicating parsing progress,
keyed to locations in the input.
For an Earley-based parser, a "garden path" is dealt with by having
Earley items record the multiple possibilities.
This need to deal with alternative possibilities
is not dissimilar to the one
which motivates other parsers to use more expensive strategies,
such as backtracking or parallel processing.

<h2>What the Man Page Says</h2>

Suppose we go all the way down the "garden path",
and it still is not clear whether the curly braces
enclose an anonymous hash or a code block?
If we alter our example to replace the deadly semicolon
with an insidious comma, this is what it looks like:
<pre><code class="prettyprint">{42;{1,2,3,4}}
</code></pre>
And for Perl 5.10, this is the result:
<pre><code class="prettyprint">{'1' => 2,'3' => 4}
</code></pre>
PPI seems to agree with Perl 5.10.

<p>Marpa::Perl, on the other hand, sees that this code is ambiguous.
It recognizes two parses.
The first parse is the one Perl and PPI see: an anonymous hash.
Marpa::Perl's second parse treats both sets of curlies as surrounding
code blocks.
In scalar context, the value which results from this second parse
is the number 4.

<p>In cases of desperation,
we look at the documentation.
It takes some searching to find it,
but there is
a very relevant discussion in
a section of the perlref man page.
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlref.html#Making-References">
It is worth reading</a>.
Of its several examples,
this is the most interesting:
<pre><code class="prettyprint">sub showem {       { @_ } }   # ambiguous (currently ok, but may change)
</code></pre>
Here Perl's rules of thumb result in the "<tt>{ @_ }</tt>"
being parsed as a code block --
the opposite of the behavior in our previous example.

<p>The threat made in the comment --
that TPP's current behavior may change --
would be a hard thing to make good on.
Assuming array context,
the effect of having the
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlref.html">perlref</a>
example flip semantics
would be to change
the return value from an
array into a hash ref.
That kind of silent change is not the kind
of thing I like to see in production code.

<p>Most Perl programmers are probably not aware of this gotcha.
Even well-informed programmers
can easily write ambiguous code by accident,
and will receive no warning of their mistake.
Perhaps a good application for Marpa::Perl
would be spotting ambiguities like these.

<h2>How to Disambiguate</h2>

<p>Once spotted, ambiguous curlies are easy to fix.
A standard way to disambiguate
an anonymous hash
is to prefix the
curly braces
with a plus sign:

<pre><code class="prettyprint">{42;+{1,2,3,4}}
</code></pre>
TPP, PPI and Marpa::Perl have no trouble
recognizing that the inner curly brackets enclose an anonymous hash in
the above.

<p>A programmer can disambiguate code blocks by
placing a semicolon as the first thing inside the curly brackets.
<pre><code class="prettyprint">{42;{;1,2,3;4}}
</code></pre>
The inner curlies in the above are recognized
as defining a code block by all three parsers:
TPP, PPI and Marpa::Perl.

</center>
<h2>Truth == Simplicity?</h2>

<p>In other posts,
I talked about improvements to Jay Earley's parsing algorithm
-- some from Joop Leo, some from Aycock and Horspool,
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">some of mine
</a>.
Here I'd like to talk about Jay Earley's original algorithm.
A common belief of great scientists is that,
if an idea is basic and true,
it is in essence also simple,
and therefore it must have a simple explanation.
</p>
<p>
Finding the simple explanation might be far from simple.
But a simple explanation there ought to be.
I like to look for those simple explanations.
Writing my mathematical novel, <i>The God Proof</i>,
confirmed
me in this habit.
Whenever I am studying something,
and it seems important and true,
I look for the simple explanation.
</p>

<h2>Dotted Rules</h2>

<p>
The idea behind Earley's algorithm is that you can
parse by building a table of rules
and where you are in those rules.
"Where" means two things: location in the rule relative to the rule's
symbols,
and location relative to the parse's input stream.
</p>
<p>
Let's look at an example of a rule in a context-free grammar.
Here's the rule for assignment in perl's
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y
</a>:
<pre><code class="prettyprint">
    termbinop => term ASSIGNOP term
</code></pre>
In parsing this rule, we can be at the beginning, before all of the symbols.
We can also be immediately after any of the three symbols.
That's a total of four possible locations.

<h2>PPI, perly.y and Marpa</h2>

<p>Recently I've been combining the two main approaches to
parsing Perl. 
One of these is the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/">PPI</a>
module.
The other is the parser in the actual
Perl distribution.
This is usually what is meant when
someone speaks simply of
"the Perl parser".
That
can be confusing
in this context,
so I will call the parser in the distribution,
the Traditional Perl Parser (TPP).

<p>I used the grammar in the TPP
(it's in
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>).
But I threw out TPP's lexer
(<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/toke.c">toke.c</a>).
I replaced
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/toke.c">toke.c</a>
with
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/lib/PPI/Tokenizer.pm">PPI::Tokenizer</a>,
rewrote TPP's bison grammar to use
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
and put the two together.

<p>To my surprise, mating the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/lib/PPI/Tokenizer.pm">PPI::Tokenizer</a>
and 
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>
has proved almost easy.
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/">PPI</a>
preserves whitespace and the TPP does not,
so I had to throw whitespace away.
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/">PPI</a>
combines some tokens that TPP separates.
(Notably
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/">PPI</a>
often combines sigils with other things.
The TPP never does.)
Also, there was the slightly more complicated issue of the ghostly semicolons,
which I'll deal with in a bit.

<p>I've gotten this combination working
on the Perl subset that
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Dumper/">Data::Dumper</a>
produces as output,
and it passes an appropriately selected dozen of
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Dumper/">Data::Dumper</a>'s
own test cases.
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Dumper/">Data::Dumper</a>
uses only part of Perl's semantics,
and that allows me to avoid
most of Perl's semantics.
Not that the semantics in
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Dumper/">Data::Dumper</a>'s
output are trivial.
They include a lot
of the logic of Perl expressions,
and the test cases get into some very serious nested dereferencing of lvalues.

<p>I don't ever intend to reimplement all (or even most)
of Perl's <b>semantics</b>.
Tricky lvalue indirections or not,
what I've done is a toy
in comparison with the Perl semantics,
and it will stay that way.
But I do think it possible to use
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
to reimplement
most of Perl's <b>grammar</b>.
An application could then plug its own semantics into it.

<p>I've adhered to the structure of
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>'s
grammar.
My intent is that this adaptation of
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>'s
grammar to
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
will work for cases much broader than
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Dumper/">Data::Dumper</a>
output.
As this project progresses,
I expect to be forced to confront a lot of interesting issues in
Perl's grammar.

<h2>The Case of the Ghostly Semicolons</h2>

<p>
But for the moment, let's get back to interfacing
the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/">PPI</a>
lexer to <a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>'s grammar,
and what turned out to be relatively simple issues.
For reasons which probably have to do with the limits of its underlying LALR algorithm,
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>
wants all expressions inside hash
brackets to end in semicolons.
That is, instead of 
<pre>
<tt>$p->{ func() }</tt>
</pre>
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a> needs to see
<pre>
<tt>$p->{ func(); }</tt>
</pre>
In actual Perl code that semicolon causes a syntax error.
But
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>
not only allows the semicolon --
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>
requires it.
These semicolons are only allowed to exist
as momentary "ghosts" inside the TPP,
where they flit from
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/toke.c">toke.c</a>
to
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>.

When exactly are ghost semicolons required?
Beats me.
The
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/toke.c">toke.c</a>
code for
handling curly braces is as convoluted as anything I've ever seen,
and I don't know of any documentation for it -- certainly the
comments do no more than hint at what's going on.

<p>Now, you'd think to mate
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/lib/PPI/">PPI</a>,
and
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>
I would need to figure out exactly when to insert "ghost" semicolons and when not.
I'd have to then implement this, ending up
with something that looks a lot like (shudder)
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/toke.c">toke.c</a>
rewritten in Perl.
But I don't have to do any of this.
You see, I've got Ruby Slippers.

<h2>Stepping Out with the Ruby Slippers</h2>

As most readers will recall, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_slippers">
Ruby Slippers
</a>
are Dorothy's shoes
in the movie <i>Wizard of Oz</i>, and they grant wishes.
In particular, Dorothy wants to get back to Kansas,
and she discovers that,
so long as she keeps the Ruby Slippers away from wicked witches,
all she has to do is wish she
is back in Kansas and she is there.

<p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>'s
parse engine has the very nice property that at every
point Marpa knows
exactly what parses are possible,
and it knows this information in a form
that it can share with the lexer.
This ability is a by-product of my rewrite of the Earley parse engine,
and has been useful beyond my expectations.
Here's how I deal with the ghostly semicolons.

<p><b>Step 1</b>:
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
has an "interactive" parse mode --
interactive in the sense that the parser and lexer interact.
What I do is just take the closing curly brace as I get it from
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/lib/PPI/Tokenizer.pm">PPI::Tokenizer</a>
and pass it on to the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
implementation of the <a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a> grammar.
In cases where an "un-semi-coloned" closing curly is acceptable, 
that's the end of the story.

<p><b>Step 2</b>:
But what if
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa
</a>/<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y
</a>
needs the semi-colon?
In interactive mode, when the parser is not happy with an
input, it stops, marking the point in the token stream
where it failed.
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
also makes available a list of tokens 
which <b>are</b> acceptable.

<p><b>Step 3</b>:
Here's where
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>'s
version of Ruby Slippers comes in.
All the application/tokenizer has to do is
pick a token which the parser <b>does</b> want,
dummy up the input so that the wanted token is the next token,
and restart the parse.
Poof, you're in Kansas.

<p>The Ruby Slippers method is quite remarkable.
In many practical cases, there is only one acceptable token.
In those cases, the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
parser tells the lexer exactly
how to make a grammar work as it goes along,
on a case by case basis.

<p>Issues with Ruby Slippers parsing can arise.
Sometimes there is
more than one acceptable token.
In those cases,
you rank your choices,
use lookahead,
look at
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>'s
ambiguous parsing capabilities, etc., etc.
Also, in some situations it may be important that all illegal parses
fail -- liberal acceptance of input is not always what is wanted.
You might need to be fascist,
rejecting everything which is not in exactly correct format.
Fascists need to be careful with their Ruby Slippers.

<h2>The Ruby Slippers Strike Again</h2>

<p>A more complex example of Ruby Slippers parsing
(and a pretty nifty one if I say so myself)
is in
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>.
This is
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
adapted to parse HTML is a very liberal way.
You can feed any file to
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
and get an HTML parse for it.
If the file is pathological HTML, or not HTML at all,
the HTML parse will be pathological,
but there <b>will</b> be an HTML parse.
(This is not totally crazy.
Most renderers accept any text whatsoever,
doing their best to render it on the screen as HTML.)

<p>As part of being very liberal,
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
supplies missing end tags, even end tags which are required
under the standards.
For traditional parsing methods,
this is a devilishly complex problem.
Try writing BNF that allows for missing end tags when possible.
Actually, just try defining "when possible".
I think you'll see it's very, very hard.

<p>But to solve this problem of end tags with
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
I don't need to
work out BNF or even define that slippery phrase
"when possible".
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
supplies missing end tags using the Ruby Slippers method.

<p>It's basically the same trick as before.
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
sets
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
to parse in interactive mode.
Then it simply feeds the tags it has to
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>,
as is,
and waits for
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
to have a problem.

When
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
can't use a token,
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
stops.
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
tells the tokenizer which token it could not use,
and which tokens it <b>could</b> use instead -- its list of "expected" tokens.

<p>The
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
tokenizer looks in the expected tokens.
Is there an end tag in there?
If so, it dummies
up a token for that end tag, sticks it in the input
stream, and restarts.

<p>Are there complications?
If
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
were parsing strict HTML, there wouldn't be.
For strict HTML,
whenever there is a missing end tag,
there will be only
one missing end tag.
In the strict HTML case,
the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
parser can always tell the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
exactly the right fix for any missing end tag.

<p>If you want to parse liberalized and defective HTML,
which
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
does,
things are more complex.
In some cases the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
parser suggests more than one 
way to dummy up the input --
more than one pair of Ruby Slippers, so to speak.
In these cases
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
has to decide "which shoes to wear."
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">Marpa::HTML</a>
uses a handful of simple
rules and heuristics.
The rules provide the right answer where there is one.
If it comes down to guessing at the intent,
the heuristics make good suggestions.

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p>On this project,
obvious thanks are due to Larry Wall
and the other authors for
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/perly.y">perly.y</a>
and
<a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JESSE/perl-5.12.1/toke.c">toke.c</a>.
as well as to Adam Kennedy for
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/PPI/">PPI</a>.
Not so obvious might be my debt to Randal Schwartz, whose
<a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/col29.html">
Oct 2001
Linux Magazine column</a>
suggested the idea of using
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-Dumper/">Data::Dumper</a>
output (and its test cases) to create
an initial subset for a Perl parser.

<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-0.102000/">Marpa</a> now parses grammars with right-recursions in linear time (O(n)).

<p>This means that <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-0.102000/">Marpa</a> is now O(n) for all LR-regular grammars.
LR-regular means LR with infinite lookahead using regular expressions.
That a big class of grammars.  It obviously includes all the LR(k) grammars,
and therefore everything parsed by Yapp, yacc, and bison.
LR-regular grammars also include
everything parseable by recursive descent, PEGs,
and other LL(k) grammars.
LR-regular definitely includes all regular expressions.

<p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-0.102000/">Marpa</a>'s O(n) behavior has another nice feature.
When it does <b>not</b> parse in O(n) time, it still parses.
Some parser generators always parse quickly, because when they
can't parse quickly, they don't parse at all.
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-0.102000/">Marpa</a> will parse anything you can write in BNF,
even highly ambiguous grammars,
and the absolute worst case is cubic (O(n**3)).

<p>In my last post, I explained that the previous release of
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-0.102000/">Marpa</a> could parse unusually 
large classes of grammars in linear time,
and that the right recursive cases where <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-0.102000/">Marpa</a> was not linear could
usually be worked around.
In fact, my experience had been that working around a right recursion was
easy, so I'd never bothered looking hard at the issue.

<p>Sometimes, writing a long explanation of why a limitation does
not matter makes me think:
Perhaps it does matter enough to take
a second look.  And take a second look is what I did.

<p>A 1991 article by Joop Leo had laid out a modification to Earley's
algorithm (the basis of Marpa) which was O(n) for all LR-regular
grammars.  Problem was, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-0.102000/">Marpa</a> already incorporated other, major,
enhancements to Earley's from another article, <a href="http://www.cs.uvic.ca/~nigelh/Publications/PracticalEarleyParsing.pdf">this one by Aycock
and Horspool and dating to 2002</a>.
Were the two modifications compatible?

<p>They are.  And <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jkegl/Marpa-0.102000/">Marpa 0.102000</a> is the result.  CPAN and the Perl
community has it,
and everybody else will have it
when they borrow from us.

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
Also,
I will continue to dual-post for some time,
and have not yet frozen comments on the versions of the
post at
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>.
