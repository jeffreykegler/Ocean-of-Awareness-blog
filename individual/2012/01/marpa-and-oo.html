</center>
<p>
Both
<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=900763">publicly</a>
and privately I hear from folks who
tell me that
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa</a>
is an OO
superclass waiting to happen.
I can see their point.
If there ever was a case for code reuse,
the Marpa algorithm is one.
On the other hand,
any non-trivial use of
Marpa requires additional semantics,
so that the Marpa classes
walk, swim and quack
very much like abstract type classes.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the additional semantics
that Marpa needs comes in pieces -- semantic actions.
And even though these pieces
often share little code
with each other,
they interact heavily
as part of a specific
structure.
This means that their semantics are tightly coupled,
both to each other and to Marpa.
In short, Marpa's semantic actions look a lot
like the methods of a subclass.
</p>
<p>
Not that there aren't issues.
In particular,
if Marpa were a superclass,
its subclasses wouldn't know which methods they
needed to implement
until after the grammar was fully specified --
in other words until deep into runtime.
But if you're into OO, there are no problems,
just interesting challenges.
</p>
<p>
A top priority with me is to empower those
who have ideas for alternative Marpa interfaces,
whether object-oriented or not.
Currently,

<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS>Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>
is divided into two layers.
The core algorithm is in a C library (libmarpa).
The interface code is the upper layer.
Written in Perl,
this upper layer calls libmarpa.
But in
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS>Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>,
libmarpa's interface was not documented,
and frankly the
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS>Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>
version of libmarpa was
so hackish that it needed to
be rewritten
before it could be effectively
and clearly documented.
In the development version of Marpa,
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-R2/">Marpa::R2</a>,
this rewrite
has been completed,
and the libmarpa documentation is now underway.
</p>
<p>
With a documented libmarpa interface,
authors of new Marpa interfaces can totally bypass
the current
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS>Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>
interface.
And in terms of speed, they'll start the race
with an advantage --
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-R2/">Marpa::R2</a>

is 20% faster
than
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS>Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>.
</p>
<p>
But why wait for
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-R2/">Marpa::R2</a>
to try out your ideas?
At the cost of a modest overhead,
a new OO interface can be layered on top of
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS>Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>.
The new interface can simply define a default action
to
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS>Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>,
one that implements
your wrapper's semantics.
Supplying an OO context to Marpa's semantic actions
is easy.
All
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS>Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>'s
actions receive as their first
argument a "per-parse variable".
The per-parse variable can be initialized
to anything the upper layer wants.
A wrapper object could pass itself to Marpa's
semantic actions as their per-parse variable.
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS>Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>'s
semantic actions can then easily use
the wrapper object to call one of the wrapper's
methods,
passing it the semantic action's other arguments.

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
Also,
I will continue to dual-post for some time,
and have not yet frozen comments on the versions of the
post at
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>.
