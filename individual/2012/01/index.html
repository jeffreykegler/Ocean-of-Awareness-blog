<center><a name="marpa-and-oo"> <h2>Marpa and OO</h2> </a>
</center>
<p>
Both
<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=900763">publicly</a>
and privately I hear from folks who
tell me that
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa</a>
is an OO
superclass waiting to happen.
I can see their point.
If there ever was a case for code reuse,
the Marpa algorithm is one.
On the other hand,
any non-trivial use of
Marpa requires additional semantics,
so that the Marpa classes
walk, swim and quack
very much like abstract type classes.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the additional semantics
that Marpa needs comes in pieces -- semantic actions.
And even though these pieces
often share little code
with each other,
they interact heavily
as part of a specific
structure.
This means that their semantics are tightly coupled,
both to each other and to Marpa.
In short, Marpa's semantic actions look a lot
like the methods of a subclass.
</p>
<p>
Not that there aren't issues.
In particular,
if Marpa were a superclass,
its subclasses wouldn't know which methods they
needed to implement
until after the grammar was fully specified --
in other words until deep into runtime.
But if you're into OO, there are no problems,
just interesting challenges.
</p>
<p>
A top priority with me is to empower those
who have ideas for alternative Marpa interfaces,
whether object-oriented or not.
Currently,

<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS>Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>
is divided into two layers.
The core algorithm is in a C library (libmarpa).
The interface code is the upper layer.
Written in Perl,
this upper layer calls libmarpa.
But in
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS>Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>,
libmarpa's interface was not documented,
and frankly the
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS>Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>
version of libmarpa was
so hackish that it needed to
be rewritten
before it could be effectively
and clearly documented.
In the development version of Marpa,
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-R2/">Marpa::R2</a>,
this rewrite
has been completed,
and the libmarpa documentation is now underway.
</p>
<p>
With a documented libmarpa interface,
authors of new Marpa interfaces can totally bypass
the current
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS>Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>
interface.
And in terms of speed, they'll start the race
with an advantage --
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-R2/">Marpa::R2</a>

is 20% faster
than
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS>Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>.
</p>
<p>
But why wait for
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-R2/">Marpa::R2</a>
to try out your ideas?
At the cost of a modest overhead,
a new OO interface can be layered on top of
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS>Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>.
The new interface can simply define a default action
to
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS>Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>,
one that implements
your wrapper's semantics.
Supplying an OO context to Marpa's semantic actions
is easy.
All
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS>Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>'s
actions receive as their first
argument a "per-parse variable".
The per-parse variable can be initialized
to anything the upper layer wants.
A wrapper object could pass itself to Marpa's
semantic actions as their per-parse variable.
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS>Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>'s
semantic actions can then easily use
the wrapper object to call one of the wrapper's
methods,
passing it the semantic action's other arguments.

</center>
<p>
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>
is a general context-free parser.
What does that mean?
For a grammar writer, it means that he doesn't
need to worry that the next rule he adds to the grammar
is the one that makes it hit the invisible wall that
most other parser generators set up.
If you can write it in BNF, Marpa will parse it.
Which makes
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>
good at incremental development.
</p>
<p>
As you develop your Marpa grammar,
you can track the tradeoffs you are making
between features and efficiency.
Chances are,
if your grammar is unambiguous or lightly ambiguous,
there are no tradeoffs --
you're getting everything you want in linear time.
Marpa is linear for every class of grammar currently in
practical use.
</p>
<p>
Marpa is also linear with many ambiguous grammars
and, in the worst case,
Marpa's time complexity
is what is accepted as optimal in practice.
Whatever the time complexity that you're seeing with Marpa,
it's probably as good or better than you're going to get
from another parser generator.
</p>
<h2>One way to start the semantics</h2>
<p>

As you build your grammar out, of course,
you'll need a semantics.
I often start my Marpa semantics with a single routine,
something like:
<code class="prettyprint"><pre>
sub My_Actions::do_what_I_mean {

    # The first argument is the per-parse variable.
    # At this stage, just throw it away
    shift;

    # Throw away any undef's
    my @children = grep { defined } @_;

    # Return what's left
    return scalar @children > 1 ? \@children : shift @children;
}
</pre></code>
</p>
<p>
When defining the grammar,
I set <code class="prettyprint">do_what_I_mean</code>
as the default action:
<code class="prettyprint"><pre>
    default_action => 'My_Actions::do_what_I_mean',
</pre></code>
</p>
<p>
This one function is enough to get me started
working out the semantics of my parse tree.
At every node of the parse tree,
it throws away all the undefined child values.
If no child value remains, an <code class="prettyprint">undef</code>

is returned.
If only one child value remains, it is the result.
If more than one child value remains,
a reference to an array of them is returned.
The result, when handed to Data::Dumper,
is a reasonable representation of your parse tree.
</p>
<p>
The "per-parse variable" is also thrown away.
By default, this is an empty hash which can be
used as a kind of global scratchpad in the parse.
This will be useful, for example,
if your language has a symbol table.
</p>
<p>
The <code class="prettyprint">do_what_I_mean</code> function produces
a first cut at a parse tree,
which I can hack away at.
For example, if I'm writing a calculator, I can change the actions
rule by rule to perform the calculations.
</p>
<p>
Your <code class="prettyprint">do_what_I_mean</code> function might vary,
depending on your application.
You might find it is better to keep all the undefineds, for example.
Also, once your grammar is complete,
you should check to see if you can do without a <code class="prettyprint">default_action</code>.
If you can, eliminating it is an efficiency gain.
This efficiency gain will be even bigger in Marpa::R2,
Marpa's next release.

</center>
<p>
To those who have noted that
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::XS">
Marpa::XS</a>
does not come with a lexer,
I'd respond that,
in a very real sense it does --
Perl.
Perl5 is a powerful lexical analyzer.
</p>
<p>
If you're trying to figure out how to write your first Marpa
parser,
I'd recommend a close look at 
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/wolfgang_kinkeldei/2011/12/trying-marpa-to-parse-css.html">
Wolfgang Kinkeldei's recent posting about his
Marpa-powered CSS parser</a>.
Wolfgang lays his parser out in a very elegant fashion,
and I find his code makes an excellent template.
</p>
Especially nice-looking is Wolfgang's lexer.
Wolfgang follows one of the two
main strategies for lexical analysis in 
Perl:
he consumes the input using substitution
(<code class="prettyprint">s/ ... / ... /</code>) commands.
<p>

</p>
The other strategy is to use the Perl regex search position
to track the progress of the lexical analysis.
In the search-position strategy,
your cases consist of a lot of 
match commands using the <code class="prettyprint">\G</code> anchor
and the <code class="prettyprint">gc</code> modifier:
<code class="prettyprint">m/\G ... /gc</code>.
An excellent tutorial on this
kind of lexing,
albeit in a non-Marpa context,
can be found in
<a href="#DOMINUS">Mark Jason Dominus's book,
<cite>Higher Order Perl</cite></a>.
Mark's coverage of lexing is in
Chapter 8, "Parsing", on pages 359-375.
Mark's book can be read
<a href="http://hop.perl.plover.com/book/">
on-line</a>.
I highly recommend Mark's book
and own a paper copy.
