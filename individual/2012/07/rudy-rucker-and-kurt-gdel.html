</center>
<p>My major interest is in parsing theory.
But,
according to Google Analytics,
most of my web hits are for a side interest.
A few years ago I discovered
the
<a href="http://morgenstern.jeffreykegler.com/">
Lost Morgenstern Document</a>,
an account of 
Kurt G&ouml;del's citizenship hearing which had
gone missing for so long there was doubt it had
ever existed.
Einstein was at the hearing and
Einstein's fame,
plus the fact it's a good yarn,
make the Lost Morgenstern Document
a matter of fairly wide interest.
<p>
This post is about another G&ouml;del document
which recently surfaced.
This document does not make a good yarn.
In fact, in terms of reading difficulty,
it ranges from the moderately hard to the low-grade cryptographic.
But the
<a href="http://www.rudyrucker.com/blog/2012/07/31/conversatons-with-kurt-godel/">
Rucker Notes</a>
are considerably more important
than the Lost Morgenstern Document.
<p>
Rudy Rucker (a well-known sci-fi writer who deserves
to be better known)
talked with G&ouml;del
several times and took notes,
notes which he has just put online.
This is a significant event.
G&ouml;del had unconventional views on a wide range
of topics.
G&ouml;del avoided controversy,
in part out of common sense,
and in part because he suffered from paranoia.
So he avoided publishing unpopular views except
when he had watertight proofs.
But, when talking to Rucker,
G&ouml;del speculated,
and even argued.

<p>
Rucker was almost,
but not quite unique.
Hao Wang talked with G&ouml;del at much greater length,
and Wang's notes remain the best sources for 
the ideas that G&ouml;del would not commit to writing.
But Wang's conversations were restricted by Wang's interests.
<p>
For example, G&ouml;del
had thought a lot about the nature of time.
He'd published a paper on closed timelike curves,
what in a loose sense could be called time travel.
G&ouml;del's result was pioneering.
When G&ouml;del wrote,
professional physicists did not write about time travel.
G&ouml;del made it possible for the topic,
even if it was still somewhat suspect,
to be taken seriously.
Wang, however, was not interested.
Whenever the physics
or philosophy of time
came up,
Wang changed the subject.
<p>
Based on the existence of closed timelike curves
as solutions to the mathematics of relativity,
is the possibility
of time travel to be taken seriously?
If so,
can you travel back and prevent yourself from being born?
Rucker's few pages
are, and will probably remain,
the most direct evidence we have of
G&ouml;del thoughts on these and
a heterogeny of issues.

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
Also,
I will continue to dual-post for some time,
and have not yet frozen comments on the versions of the
post at
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>.
