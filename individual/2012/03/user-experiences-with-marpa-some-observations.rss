    <title>User experiences with Marpa: some observations</title>
    <link>http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/2012/03/01#user-experiences-with-marpa-some-observations</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;
When it comes to
user experiences with Marpa,
I confess to being a highly biased source.
I hope the following observations
will be useful nonetheless.
(Marpa, for those new to this blog,
is a new, powerful and fast parser and parsing algorithm.
To learn more,
check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jeffreykegler.com/marpa&quot;&gt;its web page&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Marpa does the job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you've read user's accounts of work with BNF grammars over
the years
(I have studied many),
you know they follow a familiar pattern.
The user has some BNF.
He then tries tool X (for X substitute
yacc, bison, PEG, recursive descent, etc.)
and finds that it almost works.
Almost, but not quite.
The rest of the account describes the user
beating up his grammar in an effort to make
it fit the tool.
Perhaps 50% of the time, he reports that his effort
was wasted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The accounts from Marpa users are different,
because the problem the users of other tools spend
most of their time describing,
and spent most of their time solving,
does not exist with Marpa.
Once they have their grammar worked out,
Marpa parses it.
As a practical
matter, this difference is a big deal.
A methodology that, half the time,
takes you to a dead end,
is one that practitioners will avoid.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The reason that regular expressions became so dominant,
I am convinced,
is that they did the job.
If you can write your problem as a regular expression
(here I speak of regular expressions, not regexes)
you are guaranteed two things.
First that your regular expression engine *WILL* handle it.
Second, that it will do so in acceptable time.
Regular expressions did the job.
With Marpa, BNF does the job.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BNF as a lost art&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
An obstacle to learning Marpa seems to be
that writing BNF is something of a lost art.
BNF is not difficult.
By my accounting,
BNF is actually simpler than regular expressions.
BNF involves one idea: concatenation.
Regular expressions involve all of concatenation,
sequence and alternation.
Even if you don't agree with my way of calculating
difficulty,
I think you'll agree that
BNF is vastly simpler than Perl regexes.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
When I learned programming (around 1970),
BNF was much better known than regular expressions.
BNF had been established for years
as the way of specifying languages.
Regular expressions,
on the other hand,
did not come in prominence
before Thompson's
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_%28text_editor%29&quot;&gt;ed editor&lt;/a&gt;.
The first PDP11 assembler version of that came out in 1971,
the year I was taking the introduction to Computer Science
with Alan Perlis.
Prof. Perlis
spent a lot of time on BNF
and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_algorithm&quot;&gt;
Markov machines&lt;/a&gt;.
I cannot recall that he mentioned regular expressions.
Since then, at least
in the US, BNF and Markov machines seem to have been consigned to
nearly the same degree of oblivion.</description>
