</center>
<p>
In previous posts,
I've talked about
<a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
as an alternative to other parsers.
In this one,
I want to talk
about Marpa as an alternative
for problems where
<a href="#RE">parsing has been avoided</a>.
</p>
<p>
Because parsing HAS been avoided in the past.
And for good reason.
If you were drawn by the allure of domain-specific languages,
or yielded to the siren call of language-oriented programming,
you plunged headlong toward two pitfalls:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Your parser might not parse your grammar.
Which you might discover at any point in incremental development.
Or when a vital maintenance change came along.
</li>
<li>
Your input might not parse,
and your parse engine might leave you
with no easy way to find out
what the problem is.
Maybe your input was wrong,
maybe your grammar was wrong,
or maybe you've simply
hit the limits of that parse engine.
When it came to debugging, taking a language-based
approach was a bit like deciding to write your problem up in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%B2%E2%80%B2">P''</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
By approaching your problem as ANYTHING but a parsing
problem,
you avoided these two pitfalls.
Ambitious programmers,
after a few encounters
with the traditional parsing tools, would learn this.
And the next time they dreamed
up an elegant little DSL to finesse their design issues,
they would wake themselves up
and decide that they ain't that desperate yet.
</p>
<h2>Changing the parsing game</h2>
<p>
With 
<a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Marpa/">Marpa</a>
in the parsing game,
the rules are different.
Now, anything you can write in BNF will parse.
If your grammar falls into anything close to
one of the classes of grammar currently in practical
use, Marpa parses in linear time.
If there's a problem,
Marpa tells you exactly what it was looking for and why
it was looking for it.
</p>
The Interpreter pattern,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain-specific languages</a>,
and

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-oriented_programming">language-oriented programming</a>
are all immensely powerful techniques.
Almost any problem CAN be seen as the domain of a language.
In practice, less powerful techniques are often a better fit.
And with the traditional language-writing tools,
it was a rare problem indeed for which
a DSL was seen to justify the risk and effort.
</p>
<p>
Since it was so hard to create a new language,
reuse of languages was emphasized instead.
We've gotten  used to the idea of leveraging existing languages,
even ones which are a very poor fit to our problems,
because the alternative was even worse.
</p>
<p>
More and better DSL's could breathe new life into
our programming tools, and our programming methods.
And now that the parsing game has become easier,
DSL's are within reach in cases
where they had not been before.
</p>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>
<a name="RE">"parsing has been avoided": </a>
For the purposes of this post,
I do not include regular expressions as "parsing solutions".
This post focuses on languages,
and the term "language" is usually avoided when describing
anything within the restricted syntax accepted by regular expressions.
However, regular expressions do largely avoid the pitfalls
described in this post,
and that goes a long way to explain their popularity.

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
Also,
I will continue to dual-post for some time,
and have not yet frozen comments on the versions of the
post at
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>.
