<center><a name="whats-new-with-marpa"> <h2>What's new with Marpa</h2> </a>
</center>
Here's the Marpa "news" from the past few weeks.
(Marpa is a new, powerful and fast parser and parsing algorithm.
To learn more,
check out <a href="http://www.jeffreykegler.com/marpa">its web page</a>.)
<h2>Revision to the Theory paper</h2>
<p>
Most of my effort over the past weeks
has gone into a paper
on the math behind Marpa.
I have just uploaded
<a href="http://github.com/downloads/jeffreykegler/Marpa-theory/recce.pdf">
a revised version</a>.
I've fixed several typos, including a few nasty ones,
for which I apologize.
I've also improved the typography
and smoothed out
the presentation in many places.
The basic structure and results of the paper
are unchanged.
The paper contains pseudocode,
a correctness proof,
and proofs of my complexity claims.
</p>
<h2>Deleting old releases</h2>
<p>
I plan to remove official releases
of the various Marpa distributions
(Marpa, Marpa::XS, Marpa::PP)
that are more than one or two versions old.
My guess is that this will release
some disk space, and inconvenience nobody.
</p>
<h2>Updating the distributions</h2>

Marpa::XS and Marpa::PP will be updated to make
them compatible with a new release of Carp.
Carp changed the format of one
of its error messages,
and since I test diagnostics,
the change causes my test suite to fail.
Testing diagnostics has paid off for me,
but I am updating my tests to be less fussy
about the exact format of Carp's feedback.
I do NOT plan to update the bare name Marpa,
which is an older,
deprecated and legacy release.

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
Also,
I will continue to dual-post for some time,
and have not yet frozen comments on the versions of the
post at
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>.
