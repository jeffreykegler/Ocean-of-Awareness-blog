    <title>What's new with Marpa</title>
    <link>http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/2012/02/25#whats-new-with-marpa</link>
    <description>Here's the Marpa &quot;news&quot; from the past few weeks.
(Marpa is a new, powerful and fast parser and parsing algorithm.

check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jeffreykegler.com/marpa&quot;&gt;its web page&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;h2&gt;Revision to the Theory paper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most of my effort over the past weeks
has gone into a paper
on the math behind Marpa.
I have just uploaded
&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/downloads/jeffreykegler/Marpa-theory/recce.pdf&quot;&gt;
a revised version&lt;/a&gt;.
I've fixed several typos, including a few nasty ones,
for which I apologize.
I've also improved the typography
and smoothed out
the presentation in many places.
The basic structure and results of the paper
are unchanged.
The paper contains pseudocode,
a correctness proof,
and proofs of my complexity claims.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deleting old releases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I plan to remove official releases
of the various Marpa distributions
(Marpa, Marpa::XS, Marpa::PP)
that are more than one or two versions old.
My guess is that this will release
some disk space, and inconvenience nobody.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updating the distributions&lt;/h2&gt;

Marpa::XS and Marpa::PP will be updated to make
them compatible with a new release of Carp.
Carp changed the format of one
of its error messages,
and since I test diagnostics,
the change causes my test suite to fail.
Testing diagnostics has paid off for me,
but I am updating my tests to be less fussy
about the exact format of Carp's feedback.
I do NOT plan to update the bare name Marpa,
which is an older,
deprecated and legacy release.</description>
