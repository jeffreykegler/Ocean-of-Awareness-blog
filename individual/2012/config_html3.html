      This post is part of 
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/metapages/annotated.html#PARSE_HTML">
        a series</a>
	describing Marpa::R2::HTML,
      a configurable HTML parser.
      The last two posts described how to change
      the context and contents of the HTML
      elements, both new and existing.
      This post describes how to configure
      optional start tags -- which start tags
      are allowed to be optional,
      and under what circumstances.
    </p>
    <h3>Optional HTML tags</h3>
      Every non-empty HTML element has, in concept,
      a start and an end tag,
      but the standards allow both to be omitted in circumstances
      where it is expected that the HTML parser
      can easily "do what you mean".
      The
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-html40-19990824/sgml/dtd.html#inline">
        HTML 4.01 Strict DTD</a>
	allows end tags to be omitted for
      <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt> and
      <tt>&lt;li&gt;</tt>
	elements, for example.
	For the structural elements,
      (<tt>&lt;html&gt;</tt>,
      <tt>&lt;head&gt;</tt> and
      <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>)
	both tags can be omitted.
	The same is true for the "table body" element (<tt>&lt;tbody&gt;</tt>).
	<p>
	Marpa::R2::HTML goes well beyond the requirements of the standards.
	In Marpa::R2::HTML all end tags are optional,
	and which start tags are optional is up to you.
    <h3>How the parser works</h3>
    <p>
    In the first posts in this series I went into some detail describing
    my Marpa-based approach to HTML parsing.
    Briefly, it combines a parse engine using a "wishful thinking" grammar
    with a Ruby Slippers lexer.
    The "wishful thinking" grammar expects all elements,
    without exception,
    to have both start and end tags.
    This overstrict grammar demands tags even in cases
    where the HTML 4.01 Strict DTD
    mandates that they be treated as optional.
    <p>
    The overstrict grammar is liberalized by the Ruby Slippers.
    Marpa has an unusual property among parsers -- it is fully
    informed about the state of the parse at all points,
    and can conveniently and efficiently share that information
    with the application.
    In Marpa::R2::HTML, when the parse engine, with its
    overstrict grammar, grinds to a halt for lack
    of a tag that does not exist
    in the physical input,
    the lexer can ask the parse engine which tag it is looking for.
    It can then dummy one up, feed it to the parse engine,
    and start things back up.
    It's as simple as that.
    <p>
    And in the case of HTML end tags,
    the Ruby Slippers work stunningly well.
    Only one end tag will be expected at any point.
    Even in cases where a stack of elements must be properly terminated,
    the parse engine will request the end tags, one at a time,
    in proper order.
    The grammar can simplify life for itself by demanding a perfect
    world, and on the lexer's side, things are no harder -- it just
    has to do what it is told.
    <p>
    For start tags that are optional according to the Strict HTML 4.01,
    things are just as simple -- they occur in places where only one
    at a time will be demanded, and the Ruby Slippers lexer need
    only do what it is told to.
    However, if you want to further liberalize HTML, there will be
    cases where there is a choice between start tags, or between
    starting one element or ending another.
    <h3>Configuring the Ruby Slippers</h3>
    <p>
    In the last post,
    I showed how to configure Marpa::R2::HTML to allow or disallow
    text directly in the
    <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>
    element.
    If Marpa::R2::HTML
    encountered text that was directly part of the
    <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt> element
    and it was configured to not allow that,
    Marpa::R2::HTML would start a block
    by supplying a <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>
    start tag in front of the text.
    In other words, Marpa::R2::HTML treated
    the <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>
    start tag as optional.
    <h3>First, the results</h3>
    <p>The configuration will not be difficult,
    but it is perhaps still best to first show the result
    that I am aiming at.
    Suppose the HTML document consists of the string 
<blockquote><pre><tt>
    Hello, world
</tt></pre></blockquote>
To see how this parses by default, we run <tt>html_fmt</tt>,
as follows:
<blockquote><pre><tt>
echo 'Hello, world' |
/Users/jeffreykegler/perl5/bin/marpa_r2_html_fmt --no-added-tag-comment
</tt></pre></blockquote>
This is our result:
<blockquote><pre><tt>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Hello, world
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</tt></pre></blockquote>
This was produced using the default configuration which
resides in
<a href="http://api.metacpan.org/source/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-2.022000/g/config/default.txt">
the 
<tt>g/config/default.txt</tt> file</a>.
(All the examples is this post use version 2.022000 of Marpa::R2.)
<p>
We want to a new configuration,
call it
<tt>g/config/reject_text.txt</tt>,
that will not start a new
<tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt> element,
but instead reject the text as cruft.
To see if it worked we can use <tt>html_fmt</tt>:
<blockquote><pre><tt>
echo 'Hello, world' |
/Users/jeffreykegler/perl5/bin/marpa_r2_html_fmt \
  --compile reject_pcdata.txt  --no-added-tag-comment
</tt></pre></blockquote>
This should be our result:
<blockquote><pre><tt>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;!-- html_fmt: Next line is cruft --&gt;
    Hello, world
&lt;/body&gt;
</tt></pre></blockquote>
<p>Note that in this second example, there are no tags
for the 
<tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt> element,
and that the text is now labeled as "cruft", as desired.
    <h3>How it was done</h3>
    How would we change the default configuration file to refuse to start a new
<tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt> element in front of text?
The three relevant lines are:
<blockquote><pre><tt>
@block_rubies  = &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;body&gt;
@inline_rubies = @block_rubies &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;p&gt;
PCDATA -&gt; @inline_rubies
</tt></pre></blockquote>
<p>The symbols with an "<tt>@</tt>" sigil are lists,
which the configuration file uses as a convenient shorthand for groups
of symbols which occur frequently.
For convenience in this discussion,
let's expand them, so that relevant extract looks like this
<blockquote><pre><tt>
PCDATA -&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;p&gt;
</tt></pre></blockquote>
<p>
In the configuration file,
<tt>PCDATA</tt> can be thought of as non-whitespace text.
Precisely, it is whatever
HTML::Parser returns as text that is not whitespace
and does not have the <tt>is_cdata</tt> flag turned on.)
What this line says, is, whenever <tt>PCDATA</tt> is rejected,
try to fix the problem by
<ul>
<li>1. If possible, starting an <tt>&lt;html&gt;</tt> element.
<li>2. Otherwise, if possible, starting an <tt>&lt;head&gt;</tt> element.
<li>3. Otherwise, if possible, starting an <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt> element.
<li>4. Otherwise, if possible, starting an <tt>&lt;tbody&gt;</tt> element.
<li>5. Otherwise, if possible, starting an <tt>&lt;tr&gt;</tt> element.
<li>6. Otherwise, if possible, starting an <tt>&lt;td&gt;</tt> element.
<li>7. Otherwise, if possible, starting an <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt> element.
<li>8. Otherwise, by ending whatever element it is possible to end
at this point.  (There will be at most one.)
<li>9. Finally, if nothing else works, by marking the "PCDATA" as cruft.
</ul>
<p>
Of these alternatives, the first three allow Marpa::R2::HTML to supply missing
structural tasks, as required by the standards.
Alternatives 4, 5 and 6 allow Marpa::R2::HTML to continue building a table
if table-building is in progress.
(But note that the line does not allow Marpa::R2::HTML
to deal with rejected
PCDATA by starting a new table.)
Alternative 7 allows Marpa::R2::HTML to start a new
<tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>
element if PCDATA is rejected.
Alternatives 8 and 9 are implicity.
By default, after all the explicit Ruby Slippers
alternatives have been tried,
Marpa::R2::HTML will create a Ruby Slippers tags
for any end tag that is allowed.
And Marpa::R2::HTML always reserves the possibility of,
as a last resort,
labeling a token as "cruft" and moving on.
<p>
Once you understand how the Ruby Slippers configuration lines work,
the fix in this case becomes obvious.
In the expanded line,
elminate the
<tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>
as one of the alternatives considered for the Ruby Slippers.
In terms of the expanded line,
this means changing it to
<blockquote><pre><tt>
PCDATA -&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;
</tt></pre></blockquote>
In terms of the original set of lines,
this means changing the one for the <tt>@inline_rubies</tt>
list:
<blockquote><pre><tt>
@inline_rubies = @block_rubies &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; 
</tt></pre></blockquote>
Changing <tt>@inline_rubies</tt> will have the additional effect
of elimination the
<tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>
as a Ruby Slippers token in all cases,
which is what was actually done in our example.
