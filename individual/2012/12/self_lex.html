      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2012/self_parse.html">In
      a previous post</a>, I showed a self-parsing grammar,
      written in Marpa's new BNF interface.
      That grammar was in a tradition going back to the 70's.
      Following the tradition, I cheated a bit.
      That grammar required,
      but did not include, a lexer to make a prepass over
      its input.
      <p>
      This post contains a self-parsing
      and self-lexing grammar,
      the one for Marpa's forthcoming Scanless interface.
      This grammar is about as self-contained as a grammar can get,
      short of being encoded into a
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine">Universal
      Turing machine</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many readers will
      prefer to be introduced to the Scanless interface
      by way of
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-2.035_003/pod/Scanless.pod">
      a simpler example</a>,
      but based on the response to the previous post I know
      there are others who share my fascination with
      self-description and self-exemplification.
      And there is something to be said for reading an example
      that is a final authority on itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is certainly a practical example.
      Thk grammar that follows is used
      to parse itself and all other grammars written for the
      Marpa's Scanless interface.
      It is also used to parse the strings written
      for Marpa's BNF interface,
      the Scanless interface's predecessor.
    </p>
    <h3>Starting out</h3>
    <p>
      The grammar in this blog post is abridged a bit,
      and rearranged for ease of explanation.
      The original is
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/source/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-2.035_003/lib/Marpa/R2/meta/metag.bnf">
      here</a>.
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
# Copyright 2012 Jeffrey Kegler
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>The file starts with legalese, which I've cut.
    (The grammar is under GNU's LGPL 3.0.)
      Note the hash comment -- since this is a self-describing self-lexer,
      the grammar will eventually tell us how it deals with hash comments.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
:start ::= rules
rules ::= rule+
rule ::= &lt;start rule&gt;
  | &lt;empty rule&gt;
  | &lt;priority rule&gt;
  | &lt;quantified rule&gt;
  | &lt;discard rule&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>The <tt>rules</tt>
      symbol is the start symbol.
      Our grammar consists of a series of one or more rules,
      each one of which falls into one of five types.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      A few of the rules in our self-describing grammar are
      themselves self-describing.
      The last rule above is one of them: 
      it is a <tt>&lt;priority rule&gt;</tt>,
      one of the 5 types it allows.
      The previous two lines exemplify two of the other possibilities:
      the first is a <tt>&lt;start rule&gt;</tt>
      and the second is a <tt>&lt;quantified rule&gt;</tt>.
      </p>
      <p>
      A start rule is defined as
      consisting of the
      <tt>:start</tt>
      pseudo-symbol,
      followed by a <tt>::=</tt>
      operator,
      followed by a
      <tt>symbol</tt>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;start rule&gt; ::= (':start' &lt;op declare bnf&gt;) symbol
&lt;op declare bnf&gt; ~ '::='
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
      The parentheses can be ignored.
      Their purpose is to make life easier on the semantics
      -- they surround symbols
      that are hidden from the semantics.
    </p>
    <h3>"What I say" versus "what I mean"</h3>
    <p>When we define a grammar rule,
    sometimes we are asking Marpa to do exactly what
    we say, character for character.
    For example, in the 
"<tt>&lt;op declare bnf&gt; ~ '::='</tt>" rule above,
we are saying that the symbol
<tt>&lt;op declare bnf&gt;</tt> is exactly the string '::=' -- nothing more and nothing less.
"Do exactly what I say" rules are called lexical rules,
and for them we use the match operator ("<tt>~</tt>").
</p>
<p>In other cases, we are asking Marpa to "do what I mean".
That is, we are saying that "the rule consists of these symbols, plus I want you
to do what is reasonable with whitespace and comments."
An example of that kind of rule was
"<tt>rules ::= rule+</tt>".
Within, between, before and after the <tt>rule</tt>'s,
there will be comments and whitespace.
The whitespace is sometimes optional, sometimes required.
Spelling all this out would be very tedious.
So we want a type of rule that "does what we mean".
That kind of rule is called a "structural" rule,
and identified by the BNF operator ("<tt>::=</tt>").
    <p>Some structural rules have lexical content within them.
    An example was
"<tt>&lt;start rule&gt; ::= (':start' &lt;op declare bnf&gt;) symbol</tt>".
That is basically a structural rule, where Marpa should "do what I mean"
with whitespace and comments.
But it contains a string, <tt>':start'</tt>, which must be handled on a
"do exactly what I say" basis.
</p>
<p>
For example, in "<tt>:st art ::= rules</tt>",
"<tt>:st art</tt>" is not a valid way to specify
the <tt>:start</tt> pseudo-symbol -- interior whitespace is not allowed
inside a symbol.
Whenever a structural rule contains lexical content,
like a string or a character class,
Marpa knows that it should treat the lexical content on a
lexical, "do exactly what I say", basis.
</p>
    <p>
    The "what I mean" versus "what I say" distinction
    corresponds very closely to the distinction in Perl 6 grammars
    between the "rule" and "token".
    It also corresponds to the traditional division of labor in compilers,
    between the lexer and the parser proper.
    </p>
    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <p>Above we saw an example of a quantified rule: "<tt>rules ::= rule+</tt>".
    Here is the definition:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;quantified rule&gt;
  ::= lhs &lt;op declare&gt;
    &lt;single symbol&gt; quantifier &lt;adverb list&gt;
lhs ::= &lt;symbol name&gt;
&lt;op declare&gt;
  ::= &lt;op declare bnf&gt; | &lt;op declare match&gt;
&lt;op declare match&gt; ~ '~'
quantifier ::= '*' | '+'
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      A quantified rule contains a left hand side (LHS) symbol name,
      one of the two declaration operators,
      a
      <tt>single symbol</tt>,
      a plus or minus "quantifier",
      and an adverb list.
      The adverb list can be empty, as it was in our example,
      and in fact has been in every rule so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next come the two rule types that we've yet to see:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;discard rule&gt;
  ::= (':discard' &lt;op declare match&gt;) &lt;single symbol&gt;
&lt;empty rule&gt; ::= lhs &lt;op declare&gt; &lt;adverb list&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      We'll explain what a "discard rule" is when we encounter one.
      An empty rule indicates that its LHS symbol is nullable.
      We won't encounter an empty rule in this grammar.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;priority rule&gt; ::= lhs &lt;op declare&gt; priorities
priorities ::= alternatives+
    separator =&gt; &lt;op loosen&gt; proper =&gt; 1
&lt;op loosen&gt; ~ '||'
alternatives ::= alternative+
    separator =&gt; &lt;op equal priority&gt; proper =&gt; 1
alternative ::= rhs &lt;adverb list&gt;
&lt;op equal priority&gt; ~ '|'
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      Most rules, including most of the rules we've already seen,
      are priority rules.
      Priority rules are
      so-called because in their most complicated form they can express
      a precedence scheme.
      The typical rule in a grammar is a priority rule with only
      one priority -- a "simple" priority rule.
      All priority rules in this grammar will be of the simple kind.
      </p>
      <p>
      Within priorities, there can be alternatives,
      and we have seen examples of these.
      The self-defining rule that defined a <tt>rule</tt>
      stated that it was one of a set of 5 possible
      rule types (priority rule being among those types).
      In that self-defining rule,
      the different types of rule were alternatives within a single
      priority.
      <p>And, as long as we are on the subject of self-defining rules,
      there are two of them in this grammar.
      We have just seen the second of these.
      The definition of 
<tt>&lt;priority rule&gt;</tt> is itself a priority rule.
    </p>
    <h3>Symbols</h3>
    <p>We've used
      <tt>symbol</tt>,
      <tt>&lt;symbol name&gt;</tt>,
      and
      <tt>&lt;single symbol&gt;</tt>
      a few times.
      It's time to see how they are defined:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;single symbol&gt; ::=
    symbol
  | &lt;character class&gt;
symbol ::= &lt;symbol name&gt;
&lt;symbol name&gt; ::= &lt;bare name&gt;
&lt;symbol name&gt; ::= &lt;bracketed name&gt;
&lt;bare name&gt; ~ [\w]+
&lt;bracketed name&gt; ~ '&lt;' &lt;bracketed name string&gt; '&gt;'
&lt;bracketed name string&gt; ~ [\s\w]+
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>At this point,
      <tt>symbol</tt>
      and
      <tt>&lt;symbol name&gt;</tt>
      are
      essentially the same thing:
      someday there may be another way to specify symbols
      other than by name.
      <tt>&lt;single symbol&gt;</tt>
      means any expression guaranteed
      to produce a single symbol.
      <tt>symbol</tt>
      is obviously one;
      a character class is the other.
    </p>
    <p>The rules above contain our first mention
    of character classes and,
    by coincidence,
    our first use of character classes.
    Character classes are enclosed in square brackets,
    and look exactly like Perl character classes.
    In fact, they are implemented as Perl character classes, memoized for
    efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>Now that we know what a symbol can be,
      let's look at how right hand sides are built up:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
rhs ::= &lt;rhs primary&gt;+
&lt;rhs primary&gt; ::= &lt;single symbol&gt;
&lt;rhs primary&gt; ::= &lt;single quoted string&gt;
&lt;rhs primary&gt; ::= &lt;parenthesized rhs primary list&gt;
&lt;parenthesized rhs primary list&gt;
  ::= ('(') &lt;rhs primary list&gt; (')')
&lt;rhs primary list&gt; ::= &lt;rhs primary&gt;+
</pre></blockquote>
<p>A right hand side (RHS) is a sequence of one or more RHS "primaries".
A RHS primary can be a single symbol, a string in single quotes,
or a sublist of one or more RHS primaries in parentheses.
<h3>Adverbs</h3>
<p>And here is the syntax for adverb lists:
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;adverb list&gt; ::= &lt;adverb item&gt;*
&lt;adverb item&gt; ::=
      action
    | &lt;left association&gt;
    | &lt;right association&gt;
    | &lt;group association&gt;
    | &lt;separator specification&gt;
    | &lt;proper specification&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Adverb lists are lists of zero or more adverbs, which can be of one of five kinds.
Some of the adverbs have to do with the associativity (right/left/group)
of priorities.
Since all our "prioritized" rules are trivial (have only one priority),
this grammar does not include any of the following:
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;left association&gt; ::= ('assoc' '=&gt;' 'left')
&lt;right association&gt; ::= ('assoc' '=&gt;' 'right')
&lt;group association&gt; ::= ('assoc' '=&gt;' 'group')
action ::= ('action' '=&gt;') &lt;action name&gt;
&lt;action name&gt; ::= &lt;bare name&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>We also will not see <tt>action</tt> adverbs in this grammar,
for reasons explained below.
Here are two adverbs the we do see:
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;separator specification&gt;
  ::= ('separator' '=&gt;') &lt;single symbol&gt;
&lt;proper specification&gt; ::= ('proper' '=&gt;') boolean
boolean ~ [01]
</pre></blockquote>
<h3>Discarded tokens</h3>
<p>Next, the rules that deal with whitespace.
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
:discard ~ whitespace
whitespace ~ [\s]+
</pre></blockquote>
<p>The two rules say that sequences of whitespace are recognized
as tokens, then discarded.
It is as simple as that.
Perl-style comments are handled in the same way:
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
# allow comments
:discard ~ &lt;hash comment&gt;
&lt;hash comment&gt; ~ &lt;terminated hash comment&gt;
  | &lt;unterminated final hash comment&gt;
&lt;terminated hash comment&gt;
  ~ '#' &lt;hash comment body&gt; &lt;vertical space char&gt;
&lt;unterminated final hash comment&gt;
  ~ '#' &lt;hash comment body&gt;
&lt;hash comment body&gt; ~ &lt;hash comment char&gt;*
&lt;vertical space char&gt; ~ [\x{A}\x{B}\x{C}\x{D}\x{2028}\x{2029}]
&lt;hash comment char&gt; ~ [^\x{A}\x{B}\x{C}\x{D}\x{2028}\x{2029}]
</pre></blockquote>
<p>"Unterminated final hash comments" deal with the special
case of hash comments at the end of a file that is not properly
terminated with a newline.
The <tt>&lt;unterminated final hash comment&gt;</tt> symbol is an example of how
long angle bracketed symbol name can make things clearer.
Without the long name, it might not be evident what that rule and symbol
were trying to accomplish.
Comments, of course, can accomplish the same thing, but the long names can
be cleaner.
Their special advantage (and, in some contexts, disadvantage)
is that their fuller description
is propagated to wherever that symbol is used.
<h3>Strings</h3>
<p>In the next snippet, defining single-quoted strings,
the description is clearly too long for the symbol name,
so much of does go into a comment.
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
# In single quotes strings and character classes
# no escaping or internal newlines, and disallow empty string
&lt;single quoted string&gt;
  ~ ['] &lt;string without single quote or vertical space&gt; [']
&lt;string without single quote or vertical space&gt;
  ~ [^'\x{0A}\x{0B}\x{0C}\x{0D}\x{0085}\x{2028}\x{2029}]+
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Note the two Unicode vertical whitespace codepoints
U+2028 and U+2029 are included.
For the moment, the implementation only supports 7-bit ASCII,
so these are superfluous.
But when Unicode support is added, the grammar won't need to be changed.
<h3>Character classes</h3>
<p>Finally, there are character classes:
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;character class&gt; ~ '[' &lt;cc string&gt; ']'
&lt;cc string&gt; ~ &lt;cc character&gt;+
&lt;cc character&gt; ~ &lt;escaped cc character&gt;
  | &lt;safe cc character&gt;
&lt;escaped cc character&gt; ~ '\' &lt;horizontal character&gt;

# hex 5d is right square bracket
&lt;safe cc character&gt;
  ~ [^\x{5d}\x{0A}\x{0B}\x{0C}\x{0D}\x{0085}\x{2028}\x{2029}]

# a horizontal character is any character that is not vertical space
&lt;horizontal character&gt; ~ [^\x{A}\x{B}\x{C}\x{D}\x{2028}\x{2029}]
</pre></blockquote>
<p>These are Perl character classes,
to be passed straight to Perl for intrepretation.
The grammar need only recognize strings enclosed by square brackets.
But it must deal with escaped square brackets,
and this is enough to make character
classes the most
complicated lexeme of the grammar.
    </p>
<h3>Longest tokens matching</h3>
<p>When there is a choice of lexicals, Marpa follows a longest tokens match strategy.
This means that it mostly does what you mean.
(In part this is because longest token match
is the usual default for regular expressions and
lexical analyzers, which means that programmers have been trained by their tools
to expect it.)
<p>This means that Marpa's Scanless interface will do that obvious stuff, like recognizing
that in "<tt>weeknights ~ 'Mon' | 'Tue' | 'Wed' | 'Thu' | 'Fri'</tt>", that
<tt>weeknights</tt> is one symbol and not, for example, two symbols like
"<tt>wee</tt>" and "<tt>knights</tt>".
It also means that if you have a grammar where you specify both <tt>++</tt>
and <tt>+</tt> as operators, Marpa will always prefer
the longer <tt>++</tt>.
<p>Because this is Marpa, there is a slight difference from the traditional longest
<b>token</b> matching.
Note that in Marpa's matching strategy, "tokens" is plural.
If more than one possibility has the same length, Marpa will try them all.
This does play a rule in our grammar.
For example, <tt>separator</tt> is a keyword.
But it is also a valid symbol name.
Marpa allows it to be both, and figures out which is meant at the
structural level, based on context.
    <h3>Semantics</h3>
    <p>The Scanless interface's meta-grammar, is unusual in its semantics
      because it serves a dual purpose -- it is also the grammar for Marpa's
      BNF interface, which has a different semantics.
      In practice, a grammar is usually tied tightly to one semantics,
      but this is an exception.
    </p><p>
      For most grammars in either the Marpa's BNF or Scanless interface,
      the semantics would be specified using
      <tt>action</tt>
      adverbs.
      For this grammar, there are no
      <tt>action</tt>
      adverbs -- internally,
      Marpa waits until it knows which interface the grammar will be used for,
      then uses the symbol names to determine the actions on a "just in time"
      basis.
    </p><p>
      Standard applications will
      labeling rules and alternatives with
      <tt>action</tt>
      adverbs.
      Example of this are in the documentation for the BNF
      and Scanless interfaces.
