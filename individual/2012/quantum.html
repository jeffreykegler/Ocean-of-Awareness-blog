    <p>
      Let's imagine that, the day the new machine arrives,
      you are maintaining a parser,
      and that it uses what is the current state of the art
      for production-quality parsers -- hand-written recursive descent
      with lots of added procedural logic to help it along.
    <p>
      The new computer that
      arrives to replace your staid old von Neumann machine is not
      just a quantum computer.
      It's inventors have figured out a way
      to go beyond some of the limits of quantum computing,
      so that it's fully non-deterministic (NP),
      and has additional features.
      You can superposition any time you'd like,
      and then "unsuperposition" to restart.
      And the inventors have discovered the "hidden variables" so that,
      when superpositioning, you can can examine <strong>all</strong>
      possibilities, not just one.
    <p>
      How would you rewrite your
      recursive descent logic to take advantage of this new hyper-quantum computer?
      Actually, Marpa poses the same question to you today.
      Because for all classes of grammar in practical use, including
      the LL(k) grammars parseable by recursive descent,
      Marpa is efficient non-determinism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your new hyper-quantum computer
      might seem at first to make your job as a programmer harder.
      On the hyper-quantum computer,
      many things are happening at once.
      With recursive descent on the deterministic box,
      you were dealing with a single procedural thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as you get used to the new approach,
      things may seem easier.
      In the deterministic approach,
      you only needed to follow a single thread,
      but you often needed to make that thread
      deal with multiple alternatives.
      To do this, you had to create
      state information and keep track of it yourself.
      This seemed natural because you'd gotten used to having to do it,
      but actually your logic could get very hairy.
      The hyper-quantum machine is now tracking of all these choices
      for you.
      You have to switch from thinking in terms of procedure,
      to thinking in terms of sets of alternatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before, the alternatives did not come in sets.
      You had to examine each of them on your own, track whatever relevant
      information you found.
      This certainly gave you a degree of control,
      but the backtracking was not very efficient.
      And in practice the complexity of dealing with
      all this roll-your-own state
      information severely limited the kinds of grammar that you could parse,
      and even the extent to which you understood exactly what your parser
      would and would not accept.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have to retrain yourself to think in terms of the alternatives
      available at any point,
      instead of thinking about how to come up with the alternatives.
      The hyper-quantum computer (and the Marpa parser)
      new comes up with the alternatives for you.
      You don't even have to know which alternatives are there --
      if you need to ask Marpa, it can tell you.
      But you do have to learn to ask the right questions
      at the right places.
      Once you do this, you will have a much more expressive
      and flexible language,
      translated at comparable or faster speeds
      by an easier to program,
      and easier to understand parser.

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
Also,
I will continue to dual-post for some time,
and have not yet frozen comments on the versions of the
post at
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>.
