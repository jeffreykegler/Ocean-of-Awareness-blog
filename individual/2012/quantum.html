      -- Antoine de Saint-Exupery
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Imagine that, the day the new machine arrives,
      you are maintaining a parser.
      Your parser
      is the current state of the art
      -- hand-written recursive descent.
    </p><p>
    </p>
    The new computer will
    replace your staid old von Neumann box is not
    just a quantum computer.
    It's fully non-deterministic.
    You can superposition any time you'd like,
    and then "unsuperposition" to restart.
    And when superpositioning, you can can examine
    <strong>
      all</strong>
    the possibilities, not just one.
    <p>
      How would you rewrite your
      recursive descent logic to take advantage of this new hyper-quantum computer?
      Actually, this is exactly the same question that
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Marpa/">
        Marpa</a>
      poses
      to you today.
      Because for all classes of grammar in practical use, including
      the LL(k) grammars parseable by recursive descent,
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Marpa/">
        Marpa</a>
      is efficient non-determinism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your new hyper-quantum computer
      might seem at first to make your work as a programmer harder.
      On the hyper-quantum computer,
      many things are happening at once.
      On the deterministic box,
      you were dealing with a single procedural thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as you get used to the new non-deterministic computer,
      you find ways in which it makes things easier.
      On the deterministic box,
      you only needed to follow a single thread,
      but you often needed to make that thread
      deal with multiple alternatives.
      To do this, you had to create
      state information and keep track of it yourself
      while backtracking.
      The complexity of dealing with
      all this roll-your-own state
      information severely limited the kinds of grammar that you could parse,
      and even the extent to which you understood exactly what your parser
      would and would not accept.
      Since much of the time on your old parser was spent
      backtracking,
      you no longer had a real handle on the
      time complexity in many sections of your code.
      In a couple of previous releases,
      minor changes had let the backtracking get out of hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hyper-quantum computer
      now comes up with the parsing
      alternatives for you.
      True, you have to retrain yourself to think in terms of the alternatives
      available at any point.
      But you don't even have to know which alternatives are there --
      if you need to ask the hyper-quantum computer (or
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Marpa/">
        Marpa</a>),
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Progress">
        it can tell you</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You do have to learn to ask the right questions
      at the right places.
      Once you do this,
      you have a simpler and more cleanly written parser,
      running at comparable or faster speeds.
      And you begin to think about a few changes to
      the language,
      changes that will make your language more
      natural and expressive,
      but one which
      you could not have parsed before.

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
Also,
I will continue to dual-post for some time,
and have not yet frozen comments on the versions of the
post at
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>.
