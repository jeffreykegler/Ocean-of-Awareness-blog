    <h2>Derivatives == Earley?</h2>
    <p>In a very cordial Twitter exchange with Matt Might and
      and David Darais, Prof. Might asked if I would be interesting
      in looking at his derivatives-based approach.
      I answered that I already was --
      I see Marpa<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>
      as an optimized version of the Might/Darais approach.<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
    </p>
    <p>This may sound strange.
      At first glance, our two algorithms seem about as different as
      parsing algorithms can get.
      My Marpa parser is an Earley parser, table-driven,
      and its parse engine is written in C language.
      The MDS (Might/Darais/Spiewak) parser is
      an extension of regular expressions
      which constructs states on the fly.
      MDS uses combinators and has implementations
      in several functional programming languages.
    </p>
    <h2>Grammar Flow Graphs</h2>
    <p>Why then do I imagine that Marpa is an optimized version of the MDS
      approach?
      The reason is a paper sent to
      me by Prof. Keshav Pingali at Austin: "Parsing with Pictures".<a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>
      The title is a little misleading:
      their approach is not
      <b>that</b>
      easy,
      and the paper does require some math.
      But it is a lot easier than the traditional way
      of learning the various approaches to parsing.
    </p>
    <p>The basis of the Pingali-Bilardi approach
      is the Grammar Flow Graph (GFG).
      These GFGs are the "pictures" of their title.
      GFGs are NFAs with recursion added.
      As has long been known,
      adding recursion to NFAs
      allows them to represent any context-free language.
    </p>
    <p>Pingali and Bilardi's next step is new.
      A GFG can be "simulated" using the same algorithm
      used to simulate an NFA.
      Hoswever, the result is not immediately impressive.
      The simulation does produce a recognizer, but not a good recognizer:
      Some of the strings recognized by
      the GFG simulator
      are not in the context-free language.<a id="footnote-4-ref" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>
    </p>
    <p>To repair their "simulation",
      Pingali and Bilardi add a tag to each state.
      This tag tracks where the recursion began.<a id="footnote-5-ref" href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>.
      This fixes the recognizer.
      Also, the added information is enough to allow the set
      of parse trees to be efficiently recovered from the
      sets of GFG states.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, with tags, the GFG recognizer now is a parser.
      And it turns out that this parser is not new.
      In fact, it is
      <b>exactly</b>
      Earley's algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>Pingali and Bilardi do not stop there.
      Using their new framework,
      they go on to show that all LL-based and LR-based algorithms
      are simplifications of their Earley parser.
      From this point of view,
      Earley parsing is the foundation of all context-free parsing,
      and LL- and LR-based algorithms are Earley optimizations.<a id="footnote-6-ref" href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>
    </p><h2>Step 1: the MDS algorithm</h2>
    <p>
      To show that Marpa is an optimization of the MDS approach,
      I will start with the MDS algorithm, and attempt to optimize it.
      For its functional programming language,
      the MDS paper uses Racket.
      The MDS parser is described directly,
      in the usual functional language manner,
      as a matching
      operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the MDS paper,
      the MDS parser is optimized with laziness and memoization.
      Nulls are dealt with by computing their fixed points on the fly.
      Even with these three optimizations,
      the result is still highly inefficient.
      So,
      as an additional step, MDS also
      implements "deep recursive simplication" -- in effect,
      strategically replacing laziness with eagerness.
      With this the MDS paper conjectures that the algorithm's time
      is linear for a large class of practical grammars.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2: Extended regular expressions</h2>
    <p>
      Next, we notice that the context-free grammars
      of the MDS algorithm
      are regular expressions extended to allow recursion.
      Essentially, they are
      GFG's translated into Racket match expressions.
      The equivalence is close enough that
      you could imagine the MDS paper using GFG's
      for its illustrations.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3: Simulating an NFA</h2>
    <p>
      Unsurprisingly, then,
      the MDS and GFG approaches are similar in their next step.
      Each consumes a single character to produce a
      "partial parse".
      A partial parse, for our both of these algorithms,
      can be represented as a duple.
      One element of the duple is a string representing the
      unconsumed input.
      The other is a representation of a set of parse trees.
      In the case of MDS,
      in keeping with its functional approach,
      the set of parse trees is represented directly.
      In the case of the GFG-simulator,
      the set of parse trees is compressed into a sequence of
      GFG-state-sets.
      There is one GFG-state-set for the start of parsing,
      and one for each consumed character.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3: Earley's Algorithm</h2>
    <p>At this point,
      with the introduction of the GFG state-sets to represent parse-trees,
      the MDS algorithm and its optimized GFG equivalent have
      "forked".
      Recall from above,
      that this GFG simulator has a bug --
      it is over-liberal.
      We fix this bug by tagging each GFG state with the
      the index of the GFG state-set which begins the recursion
      it is part of.
      With these tags,
      the GFG state-sets are exactly Earley sets.
    </p><h2>Step 3: The Leo optimization</h2>
    <p>Next we incorporate an optimization by Joop Leo,
      which makes Earley parsing linear for all LR-regular grammars,
      without using lookahead.
      Since LR-regular includes LR and LL, including LL(*),
      we do not bother with lookahead.
      We therefore ignore the optimizations described in the later pages
      of Pingali and Bilardi.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3: Marpa</h2>
    <p>To get from an Earley/Leo parser to a Marpa parser,
      we need to address one more major point.
      In modern parsing practice,
      programmers expect the ability to introduce procedural logic,
      even to the point of switching parsers.
      By ensuring that processing each Earley set is complete
      before processing on the next Earley set begins,
      we accomplish this.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that Marpa has available full information
      about the parse so far -- it is left-eidetic.
      Error reporting is unexcelled,
      and procedural logic can use this information as well.
      For example,
      full parse information implies full knowledge of which
      tokens are expected next.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that you can write an liberal HTML parser,
      starting with a very illiberal HTML grammar.
      When the illiberal parser encounters a point where it cannot
      continue because of a missing token,
      procedural logic can ask
      what the expected token is,
      concoct it on they fly,
      supply it to the illiberal parser,
      and ask the illiberal parser to continue.
      This is called the "Ruby Slippers" technique,
      and an HTML parser based on it has been implemented.<a id="footnote-7-ref" href="#footnote-7">[7]</a>
    </p>
    <h2>The way forward</h2>
    <p>
      As mentioned,
      the MDS algorithm has its own approach to optmization,
      one which takes maximum advantage of functional programming.
      In contrast, Marpa relies on C level coding.
    </p>
    <p>One example of the contrast in optimization techniques
      is null handling.
      Recall from above that, to deal with null processing,
      the MDS algorithm uses a fixed-point
      algorithm on the fly.
      Marpa, on the other hand,
      before parsing begins.
      precomputes a list of nullable
      symbols using bit vectors.
      In this particular case, Marpa will usually be the winner.
    </p>
    <p>A second case in which hand optimization wins is the
      all-important Leo optimization.
      Simon Peyton-Jones is a very smart man,
      but nonetheless I believe that
      the day that GHC will look at a functional specification
      of an Earley parser and rediscover the Leo optimization
      at compile time is far off.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand,
      I do not imagine that hand optimization and/or C language is the
      winner in all cases.
      A programmer who imagines that he can spot all the cases where
      lazy evaluation or memoization will be effective in the general case
      is deceiving himself.
      And of course,
      even an omniscient programmer is not going to be there at run-time
      for "just in time" optimization.
      Perhaps the optimal parser of the future will combine important hand optimizations
      with functional programming.
