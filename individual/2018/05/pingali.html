    <h2>Derivatives == Earley?</h2>
    <p>In a very cordial Twitter exchange with Matt Might and
    and David Darais, Prof. Might asked if I would be interesting
    in looking at his derivatives-based approach.
    I answered that I already was --
    I see
    Marpa as an optimized version of the Might/Darais approach.
    </p>
    <p>This may sound strange.
    At first glance, our two algorithms seem about as different as
    parsing algorithms can get.
    My Marpa parser is an Earley parser, table-driven,
    and its parse engine is written in C language.
    The MDS (Might/Darais/Spiewak) parser is
    an extension of regular expressions
    which constructs states on the fly.
    MDS uses combinators and has implementations
    in several functional programming languages.
    </p>
    <h2>Grammar Flow Graphs</h2>
    <p>Why then do I imagine that Marpa is another version of the MDS
    approach?
    The reason is a paper sent to
    me by Prof. Keshav Pingali at Austin: "Parsing with Pictures".
    The title is a little misleading:
    their approach is not <b>that</b> easy,
    and the paper does require some math.
    But it is a lot easier than the traditional way
    of learning the various approaches to parsing.
    Pingali and Gianfranco Bilardi
    (his co-author) suggest that their approach,
    taken out of the terse form it has in their
    papers,
    can make it a easier to teach
    and understand Parsing Theory.
    I think they may be right.
    </p>
    <p>The basis of the Pingali-Bilardi approach
    are Grammar Flow Graphs.
    These GFGs are the "pictures" of their title.
    GFGs are NFAs with recursion added.
    As has long been known,
    adding recursion to NFAs
    allows them to represent any context-free languages.
    </p>
    <p>What's new with Pingali and Bilardi is
    where they take their GFG's.
    A GFG can be traversed using the same algorithm
    used to simulate an NFA.
    At first glance the result is not impressive --
    the algorithm is a recognizer, not a parser,
    and it's a bad recognizer:
    It is over-liberal and recognizes string which
    are not in the context-free language.
    </p>
    <p>Next comes their real insight:
    They enhance their NFA-based algorithm
    to have it track where each recursion begins.
    (This can be done by adding an integer to each item<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.)
    This fix not only corrects the recognizer
    -- it turns it into a parser.
    </p>
    <p>
    It turns out that Pingali and Bilardi's fixed NFA algorithm
    is not new.
    In fact, it is <b>exactly</b> Earley's algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>Pingali and Bilardi do not stop there.
    Using their new framework,
    they go on to show that all LL-based and LR-based algorithms
    are simplifications of their Earley parser.
    From this point of view,
    Earley parsing is the foundation of all context-free parsing,
    and LL- and LR-based algorithms are Earley optimizations.
    <h2>Showing the equivalence: step 1</h2>
    <h2>The MDS algorithm</h2>
    <p>
    To show that Marpa is an optimization of the MDS approach,
    I will start with the MDS algorithm, and attempt to optimize it.
    For its functional programming language,
    the MDS paper uses Racket.
    The MDS parser is described directly,
    in the usual functional language manner,
    as a matching
    operation.
    In the MDS paper,
    the MDS parser is optimized with laziness and memoization.
    Nulls are dealt with by computing their fixed points on the fly.
    Even with these 3 optimizations,
    the result is still highly inefficient.
    As a last step, MDS also
    implements "deep recursive simplication" -- in effect,
    strategically replacing laziness with eagerness.
    With this the MDS paper conjectures that the algorithm's time
    is linear for a large class of practical grammars.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2: Extended regular expressions</h2>
    <p>
    Step 1 in going from the MDS algorithm to Leo/Earley/Marpa via
    the Pingali and Bilardi "pictures" is
    to notice both MDS and GFG's start at the same place:
    context-free grammars in the form of
    regular expressions extended to allow recursion.
    MDS starts with a match expression in Racket,
    and its Racket match expressions have a natural equivalent in a GFG --
    so natural you could imagine the MDS paper using GFG's
    as illustrations.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3: Following an NFA</h2>
    <p>
    The MDS and GFG approaches are also similar in their next step:
    Both follow an NFA by consuming a single character to produce a
    "partial parse".
    A partial parse, for our purposes,
    is a duple consisting of a set of parses and a string.
    The string is the remaining input,
    and the set of parses is the parses so far.
