    <p>The term "language" has a special and unusual meaning within
      Parsing Theory, one it inherited from a now nearly-extinct
      school of linguistics.
      In a previous post,
      I said that this would turn out to be more than
      just a matter of textbooks definition falling short of ideal,
      but would, because of its major effect on Parsing Theory,
      shape the daily practice of programming.
      This post supplies the evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This post takes the form of a timeline<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>
    The earlier entires in this timeline borrow heavily from
    <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2018/05/chomsky_1956.html">
          a previous blog post</a>.
      </footnote></p>
    <h2>"Language" as of 1929</h2>
    <p>In 1929 Leonard Bloomfield,
      as part of his effort to put American linguistics on a rigorous footing,
      publishes his "Postulates".
      They include his definition of language:
    </p><blockquote>
      The totality of utterances that can be made in a speech
      community is the
      <b>language</b>
      of that speech-community.<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
    </blockquote><p>
      There is no reference in this definition to the more usual view,
      that the utterances of a language "mean" something.
      This omission is not accidental:
    </p><blockquote>
      The statement of meanings is therefore the weak point in
      language-study, and will remain so until human knowledge
      advances very far beyond its present state. In practice, we define the
      meaning of a linguistic form, wherever we can, in terms of some
      other science.<a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>
    </blockquote><p>
      Bloomfield is passing the buck in this way,
      because he wants linguistics to become regarded as a science,
      and the positivist science of his time abhors
      unverifiable statements,
      and therefore any claims about mental states.
      A claim to know what someone "means" can be read
      as a claim to know what's in their mind,
      and mind-reading has a poor reputation among positivists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Draconian as the exclusion of meaning is,
      it is a big success.
      Known as structural linguistics,
      Bloomfieldian linguistics dominates lingustics for
      the next couple of decades.
    </p>
    <h2>1955: Noam Chomsky graduates</h2>
    <p>
      Noam Chomsky earns his PhD at the Universtity of Pennsylvania.
      His teacher, Zelig Harris, is a prominent Bloomfieldian,
      and Chomsky's early work is thought to be in the Bloomfield school.<a id="footnote-4-ref" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>
      Chomsky becomes a professor at MIT.
      MIT does not have a linguistics department,
      and Chomsky is free to teach his own approach to the subject.
    </p>
    <h2>The term "language" as of 1956</h2>
    <p>Chomsky publishes his "Three models" paper,
      one of the most important papers of all time.
      His definition of language now uses the terminology
      of set theory,
      but its substance comes from Bloomfield:
    </p><blockquote>
      By a language then, we shall mean a set (finite or infinite) of
      sentences, each of finite length, all constructed from a finite
      alphabet of sysbols.  If A is an alphabet, we shall say that
      anything formed by concatenating the symbols of A is a string in
      A. By a grammar of the language L we mean a device of some sort that
      produces all of the strings that are sentences of L and only these.<a id="footnote-5-ref" href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>
    </blockquote><p>
      Chomsky does not intend to
      follow in the Bloomfieldian tradition of avoiding considerations
      of meaning, aka semantics:
    </p><blockquote>
      [...] it would be absurd to develop
      a general syntactic theory
      without assigning an absolutely
      crucial role to semantic considerations,
      since obviously the necessity to support
      semantic interpretation is one of the primary
      requirements
      that the structures
      generated by the syntactic component of a grammar
      must meet.<a id="footnote-6-ref" href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>
    </blockquote><p>
      Already in "Three Models",
      Chomsky brings in semantics,
      when it is useful to show
      that his model is superior:
      When an utterance is ambiguous,
      Chomsky's new model produces multiple derivations
      each of which "look" like the natural representation
      of one of the meanings.
      Chomsky points out that this is a very
      desirable property for a model to have.<a id="footnote-7-ref" href="#footnote-7">[7]</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Oettinger 1961</h2>
    <p>
      While the stack itself goes back to Turing<a id="footnote-8-ref" href="#footnote-8">[8]</a>,
      its significance for parsing becomes an object
      of interest in itself with
      Samuelson and Bauer's 1959 paper<a id="footnote-9-ref" href="#footnote-9">[9]</a>.
      Mathematical study of stacks as models of computing begins with Anthony Oettinger's 1961 paper.<a id="footnote-10-ref" href="#footnote-10">[10]</a></p>
    <p>Oettinger 1961 is full of evidence that stacks
      (which he calls "pushdown stores") are very new.
      Oettinger, for example, does not use the terms "push" or "pop",
      but instead describes operations on his pushdown stores using
      a set of vector operations which will later form the basis
      of the APL language.
      As of 1961, all algorithms with acceptable speed are using
      stacks with various modifications.
      Oettinger express a hope:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The development of a theory of pushdown algorithms should
      hopefully lead to systematic techniques for generating
      algorithms satisfying given requirements to replace
      the ad hoc invention of each new algorithm.<a id="footnote-11-ref" href="#footnote-11">[11]</a>
    </blockquote><p>
      Oettinger hopes his pushdown store model of computing --
      what will eventually be called
      deterministic pushdown automata (DPDA's) --
      will become the basis of a theory of language
      computing encompassing both natural language
      (including the Russian which is the object of his own research)
      and computing languages like ALGOL.
      For natural language translation,
      DPDA's will prove totally inadequate.
      But DPDA's will continute to be the basis
      of hopes for a theory of computer language parsing.
      And the quote above more than hints at an expectation
      of One Stack Parsing Algorithm to Rule Them All.
    </p>
    <h2>Knuth 1965</h2>
    <p>In a pivotal LR(k) paper.
      that Donald Knuth sets out a theory that explains
      all the "tricks"<a id="footnote-12-ref" href="#footnote-12">[12]</a>
      used for efficient parsing up to that time.
      Knuth sets out a comprehensive theory of stack-based
      parsing algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a start, Knuth shows that stack-based parsing is
      equivalent to a new and unexpected class of grammars
      LR(k), and he provides with a parsing algorithm for them.
      This algorithm might be expected to be "the one to rule
      them all".
      Unfortunately Knuth's LR(k), while deterministic and linear,
      is not practical -- it requires huge tables well beyond
      the memory capabilities of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knuth, in his program for further research<a id="footnote-13-ref" href="#footnote-13">[13]</a>,
      suggests using grammars rewrites or table manipulations
      to streamline parsers for LR(k) or
      LR(k) subclasses.
      Knuth also suggests investigation of parsers for superclasses
      of and even describes a class of parsers with more aggressive lookahead -- LR(k,t).
      But he is clearly skeptical about LR(k,t)<a id="footnote-14-ref" href="#footnote-14">[14]</a>
      and, we may assume,
      even more skeptical about more general approaches.<a id="footnote-15-ref" href="#footnote-15">[15]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Knuth is certainly aware that DPDA determinism and
      linear time behavior are not the same thing.<a id="footnote-16-ref" href="#footnote-16">[16]</a>
      An algorithm can be more powerful than a DPDA,
      while still being linear.
      But linearity is a stand-in for "practical",
      and, with his discovery that even DPDA-based
      algorithms can be impractical,
      Knuth, and the research community,
      decide that it is extremely unlikely than more
      powerful computing models will also be faster in
      practice.
    </p>
    <h2>The term "language" as of 1965</h2>
    <p>
       Why was such a powerful skepticism based on the results for one
       computing model of computing?
       Stacks, as we now call them, are a natural model of computing,
       so it is reasonable to think they form a step on the hierarchy
       of tradeoffs of power against practical speed.
       But very important was the proof that LR(k) grammars were
       "equivalent" to DPDA's.

      That my conclusions about Knuth's skepticism are not misreadings

      in which he planned to use pre-Chomskyan bottom-up methods. (See
      Knuth, Donald E., "The genesis of attribute grammars",

      Springer, September 1990, p. 3.)
      In any case, and more importantly,
      after Knuth 1965
      the research community certainly was strongly
