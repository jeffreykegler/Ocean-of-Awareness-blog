      What, going forward, will you want in a parser?
      The question may sound presumptious
      (how do I know what you want, much less what you
      <b>will</b> want) but I think it can be answered
      with some confidence.
      The way to do this is to look at what you
      have wanted in the past,
      with "you" being represented by a wide
      variety of top practitioners and theorists.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this post,
    the parser I am speaking of is the mainframe parser --
    the one that is used in state of the art parser generators.
    In many situations, of course, what you want is the fastest
    and easiest parser that gets the job done.
    Often that job is quite narrowly defined,
    and therefore
    the parser can be quite limited in its power,
    especially if it's fast and easy to deploy.
    For example, when you have a regular expression to parse,
    you're not looking for anything more than a regular expression
    engine.
    </p>
    <p>
    But regular expressions themselves
    are an example of one important property that you will
    want in a parser.
    They are predictably and reliably fast.
    "Fast" here means they are linear or quasi-linear.
    "Predictably" means that they are fast for a predictable
    set of grammars.
    In the case of regular expressions,
    it is not hard to determine if a grammar is a regular expression --
    you can in fact define a notation so that
    <b>only</b> regular expressions are allowed,
    so that a programmer doesn't even need to desk-check.
    </p>
    <p>
    "Reliably" means the parser is fast for 100% of the predicted cases.
    This would go without saying,
    except that solutions to the parsing problem are often advanced
    which trade power for reliability.
    An algorithm which can go quadratic or worse is often used to supplement
    an algorithm which lacks power.
    It's a kind of cross-breeding of algorithms.
    The hope is that the hybrid, in your use case,
    had the power of the slow algorithm and the
    speed of the fast one.
    This works a lot better in botany than it does in parsing.
    Once you have a successful cross in a plant,
    you can breed from that and expect good things.
    But if even once you've lucked out with a parse,
    your next parse is a just another new toss of the dice.
    </p>
    <h1>Power</h1>
    <p>
    Which brings us to why, despite all of its very nice properties,
    people try, and often need to, do better than regular expressions:
    power.
    How wide a variety of grammars can the algorithm parse?
    In the case of regular expressions, it flunks an obvious test --
    no notation for regular expressions can be parsed by a regular expression.
    That is because, while regular expresions are
    recursive, they cannot parse recursions.
    </p>
    <p>In 19XX it was thought the next step up in power,
    consistent with the Three Basic Virtues,
    might have been found:
    A parser called yacc parsed a class of grammars called LALR.
    LALR clearly had two of the Basic Virtues (fast and reliable)
    and it could be said to have the third if you were willing to stretch a point.
    Technically,
    it took a mathematician to tell if a grammar is LALR.
    But what was probably the most sophisticated LALR grammar was
    created by Larry Wall, a non-mathematician --
    so one could get sense of it after a few hard knocks.
    </p>
