    <h2>Procedural parsing</h2>
    <p>Marpa is an Earley-based parser,
      and Earley parsers are typically not good at procedural parsing.
      Many programmers are used to recursive descent (RD),
      which has been state-of-the-art in terms of
      its procedural programming capabilities --
      it was these capabilities which led to RD's
      triumph over the now-forgotten Irons algorithm.<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Marpa, however, has parse engine expressly redesigned<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
      to handle procedural logic well.
      In fact, Marpa is <b>better</b> at procedural logic
      than RD.
      I will show this with an example.
    </p>
    <h2>A context-sensitive grammar</h2>
    <p>RD, to be sure, natively only handles LL(1) grammars,
    while Marpa parses all LR-regular grammars in linear time.
    So Marpa <b>needs</b> procedural logic much less than RD.
    As an example of a grammar for which Marpa does
    require procedural logic, we'll pick the canonical example
    of a context-sensitive, but not context-free grammar:
    </p>
    <pre>
          a^n . b^n . c^n : n >= 1
    </pre>
    This is a sequence of
    <tt>a</tt>'s,
    <tt>b</tt>'s, and
    <tt>c</tt>'s,
    in alphabetical order,
    where the character counts are all
    equal to each other and greater
    than one.
    </p>
    <p>What I outline below is, to put it mildly,
    not the best or the fastest way to recognize this particular grammar.
    Three tight loops, with counters, would do the same job nicely,
    and would be mucb faster.
    But the ABC grammar is chosen for this post precisely because,
    on one hand it is simple,
    and on the other hand is literally impossible for
    a pure context-free parsing strategy.
    The specific strategy used was picked
    because it demonstrates
    an important subset of Marpa's procedural parsing capabilities.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 1: the syntax</h2>
    <p>Our strategy will be to start with a context-free syntax,
    and then extend it with procedural logic.
    Here is the context-free grammar:
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
    lexeme default = latm => 1
    :default ::= action => [name,start,length,values]
    S ::= prefix ABC trailer
    ABC ::= ABs Cs
    ABs ::= A ABs B | A B
    prefix ::= A*
    trailer ::= C_extra*
    A ~ 'a'
    B ~ 'b'
    :lexeme ~ Cs pause => before event => 'before C'
    Cs ~ 'c' # dummy -- procedural logic reads <Cs>
    C_extra ~ 'c'
    </tt></pre>
    <p>The first line is boiler-plate:
    It turns off a default which was made pointless 
    by a later enhancement to Marpa::R2.
    Marpa::R2 is stable, and backward-compatibility is
    a very high priority.
    <pre><tt>
    :default ::= action => [name,start,length,values]
    </tt></pre>
    <p>
    The second line defines the format -- a parse tree
    whose nodes are arrays whose elements are,
    in order,
    the node name, its start position,
    its length and its child nodes.
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
    S ::= prefix ABC trailer
    </tt></pre>
    <p>The symbol <tt>&lt;ABC&gt;</tt>
    is our "target" -- the counted 
    <tt>a</tt>'s,
    <tt>b</tt>'s,
    and <tt>c</tt>'s.
    To make things a bit more interesting,
    and to make the problem more like a parsing problem instead of a counting problem,
    we allow a prefix of <tt>a</tt>'s
    and a suffix of <tt>c</tt>'s.
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
    ABC ::= ABs Cs
    </tt></pre>
    <p>We divide the 
    <tt>&lt;ABC&gt;</tt> target into two parts:
    <tt>&lt;ABs&gt;</tt>, which contains the
    <tt>a</tt>'s,
    and <tt>b</tt>'s;
    and
    <tt>&lt;Cs&gt;</tt>, which contains the
    and <tt>b</tt>'s.
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
    ABs ::= A ABs B | A B
    </tt></pre>
    <p>
    A string "<tt>a^n b^n</tt>" is context-free,
    so we can deal with
    <tt>&lt;ABs&gt;</tt> without procedural logic.
    The line above produces a non-empty string of
    <tt>a</tt>'s then
    <tt>b</tt>'s;
    with an equal number of each character.
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
    prefix ::= A*
    trailer ::= C_extra*
    </tt></pre>
    <p>As stated above,
    <tt>&lt;prefix&gt;</tt>,
    is a series of <tt>a</tt>'s and
    <tt>&lt;suffix&gt;</tt>
    is a series of <tt>c</tt>'s.
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
    A ~ 'a'
    B ~ 'b'
    </tt></pre>
    <p>Marpa::R2 has a separate lexical and syntactic phase.
    We now define our lexemes.
    The first two are simple enough:
    <tt>&lt;A&gt;</tt> is the letter "<tt>a</tt>"; and
    <tt>&lt;B&gt;</tt> is the letter "<tt>b</tt>";
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
    :lexeme ~ Cs pause => before event => 'before C'
    Cs ~ 'c' # dummy -- procedural logic reads <Cs>
    C_extra ~ 'c'
    </tt></pre>
    <p>
    For the letter "<tt>c</tt>",
    we will use procedural logic.
    As hooks for procedural logic,
    Marpa allows a full range of events.
    Events can occur on prediction and completion of symbols;
    when symbols are nulled;
    before lexemes
    and after lexemes.
    The first line in the above display
    declares a "before lexeme" event
    on the symbol
    <tt>&lt;Cs&gt;</tt>.
    The name of the event is "<tt>before C</tt>".
    </p>
    <p>The second line is a dummy entry,
    which is needed to allow the "<tt>before C</tt>"
    event to trigger.
    The entry says that
    <tt>&lt;Cs&gt;</tt> is a single letter "<tt>c</tt>".
    This is false --
    <tt>&lt;Cs&gt;</tt> is a series of one or more
    <tt>c</tt>'s,
    which needs to be counted.
    But when
    the "<tt>before C</tt>" event triggers,
    the procedural
    logic will make things right.

    <h2>Comments, etc.</h2>
    <p>
      To learn about Marpa,
      my Earley/Leo-based parsing project,
      there is the
      <a href="http://savage.net.au/Marpa.html">semi-official web site, maintained by Ron Savage</a>.
      The official, but more limited, Marpa website
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Marpa-web-site/">is my personal one</a>.

    <h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p id="footnote-1"><b>1.</b>
      TODO.
 <a href="#footnote-1-ref">&#8617;</a></p>
<p id="footnote-2"><b>2.</b>
      To handle procedural logic well,
      an Earley engine needs to complete its Earley sets
      in strict order --
      that is, Earley set <tt>N</tt>
      cannot change after work on Earley set <tt>N+1</tt>
      has begun.
      I have not looked at every Earley parse engine,
      and some may have had this strict-sequencing property.
      And many of the papers are agnostic about the order
      of operations.
      But Marpa is the first Earley parser to recognize
      and exploit strict-sequencing as a feature.
 <a href="#footnote-2-ref">&#8617;</a></p>
<p id="footnote-3"><b>3.</b>
    One objection to the use of procedural logic to describe the ABC
    grammar is that the mix of procedural and syntactic description is unnatural.
    This is true, but hack-ish as the Marpa description is,
    I think the reader will find it clearer than its purely syntactic
    "native" description as a CSG:
