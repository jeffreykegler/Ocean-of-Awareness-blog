    <blockquote>Always approach a case with an absolutely blank mind.
      It is always an advantage.
      Form no theories, just simply observe and draw inferences from your observations.
      &mdash;
        Sherlock Holmes, quoted in "The Adventure of the Cardboard Box".
        </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.
      &mdash;
        Holmes, in "A Scandal in Bohemia".
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>I make a point of never having any prejudices, and of following docilely wherever fact may lead me.
      &mdash;
      Holmes, in "The Reigate Puzzle".
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.
      &mdash;
      Holmes, in "The Sign of Four".
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      In imagination there
      exists the perfect
      mystery story.
      Such a story presents
      the essential clues, and compels us to form our own
      theory of the case.
      If we
      follow the plot carefully, we arrive at the complete
      solution for ourselves just before the author's disclosure
      at the end of the book. The solution itself, contrary to
      those of inferior mysteries, does not disappoint us;
      moreover, it appears at the very moment we expect it.
      Can we liken the reader of such a book to the scientists,
      who throughout successive generations continue to seek
      solutions of the mysteries in the book of nature? The
      comparison is false and will have to be abandoned later,
      but it has a modicum of justification which may be
      extended and modified to make it more appropriate to
      the endeavour of science to solve the mystery of the
      universe.
      &mdash;
      Albert Einstein
        and Leopold Infeld. <a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>

    <h2>The Sherlock Holmes approach</h2>
    <p>My
    <a href="https://jeffreykegler.github.io/personal/timeline_v3">
    timeline history of parsing theory</a>
      is my most popular writing, but
      it is not without its critics.
      Many of them accuse the timeline of lack of objectivity or of bias.
    </p>
    <p>
      Einstein assumed his reader's idea of methods of proper investigation,
      in science as elsewhere,
      would be similar to those Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.
      I will follow Einstein's lead in starting there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deductions recorded in the Holmes' canon
      often involve
      <b>a lot</b>
      of theorizing.
      To make it a matter of significance what the dogs in "Silver Blaze" did in the night,
      Holmes needs a theory of canine behavior,
      and Holmes' theory sometimes outpaces its pack of facts by a considerable distance.
      Is it really true that only dangerous people own
      dangerous dogs?<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Holmes's methods, at least as stated in the Conan Doyle stories,
      are incapable of solving anything
      but the fictional problems he encounters.
      In real life, a "blank mind" can observe nothing.
      There is no "data" without theory, just white noise.
      Every "fact" gathered relies on many prejudgements about what is
      relevant and what is not.
      And you certainly cannot characterize anything as "impossible",
      unless you have, in advance, a theory about what is possible.
    </p>
    <h2>The Einstein approach</h2>
    <p>Einstein, in his popular account
    of the evolution of physics,
      finds the Doyle stories "admirable"<a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>.
      But to solve real-life mysteries, more is needed.
      Einstein begins his description of his methods at the start
      of his Chapter II:
    </p><blockquote>
      The following pages contain a dull report of
      some very simple experiments.
      The account will be boring
      not only because the description of experiments is uninteresting
      in comparison with their actual performance,
      but also because the meaning of the experiments does
      not become apparent until theory makes it so. Our
      purpose is to furnish a striking example of the role of
      theory in physics.
      <a id="footnote-4-ref" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Einstein follows with a series of the kind of experiments
      that are performed in high school physics classes.
      One might imagine these experiments allowing an observer
      to deduce the basics of electromagnetism
      using materials and techniques available for centuries.
    </p>
    <p>But, and this is Einstein's point,
      this is not how it happened.
      The theory came
      <b>first</b>,
      and the experiments were devised afterwards.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      In the first pages
      of our book we compared the role
      of an investigator
      to that of a detective who, after
      gathering the requisite facts, finds the right solution
      by pure thinking. In one essential this comparison must
      be regarded as highly superficial. Both in life and in
      detective novels the crime is given. The detective must
      look for letters, fingerprints, bullets, guns, but at least
      he knows that a murder has been committed. This is
      not so for a scientist. It should not be difficult to
      imagine someone who knows absolutely nothing about
      electricity, since all the ancients lived happily enough
      without any knowledge of it. Let this man be given
      metal, gold foil, bottles, hard-rubber rod, flannel, in
      short, all the material required for performing our
      three experiments. He may be a very
      cultured person,
      but he will probably put wine into the bottles, use the
      flannel for cleaning, and never once entertain the idea
      of doing the things we have described.
      For the detective
      the crime is given, the problem formulated: who
      killed Cock Robin?
      The scientist must, at least in part,
      commit his own crime, as well as carry out the investigation.
      Moreover, his task is not to explain just one
      case, but all phenomena which have happened
      or may
      still happen. &mdash; Einstein and Infeld <a id="footnote-5-ref" href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Commiting our own crime</h2>
    <p>If then,
      we must commit the crime of theorizing before the facts,
      where does out theory come from?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    Science is not just a collection of laws,
    a catalogue of unrelated facts.
    It is a creation of the human mind,
    with its freely invented ideas and concepts.
    Physical theories try to form a picture of reality
    and to establish its connection
    with the wide world of sense impressions.
    Thus the only justification for our mental structures
    is whether and in what way our theories form such
    a link. &mdash; Einstein and Infeld <a id="footnote-6-ref" href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      In the case of planets moving around the sun
      it is found that the system of mechanics works
      splendidly.
      Nevertheless we can well imagine that another system,
      based on different assumptions,
      might work just as well.
      <br>
      Physical concepts are free creations
      of the human mind, and are not,
      however, it may seem,
      uniquely determined by the external world.
      In our endeavor to understand reality
      we are somewhat like a man trying
      to understand the mechanism of a closed watch.
      He sees the face and the moving hands,
      even hears its ticking,
      but he has no way of opening the case.
      If he is ingenious
      he may form some picture of a mechanism
      which could be responsible
      for all the things he observes,
      but he may never be quite sure
      his picture is the only one
      which could explain his observations.
      He will never be able
      to compare his picture with the real mechanism
      and he cannot even imagine the possibility
      or the meaning of such a comparison.
      But he certainly believes that,
      as his knowledge increases,
      his picture of reality will become
      simpler and simpler
      and will explain a wider and wider range
      of his sensuous impressions.
      He may also be believe in the existence
      of the ideal limit of knowledge
      and that it is approached
      by the human mind.
      He may call this ideal limit
      the objective truth. -- Einstein and Infeld <a id="footnote-7-ref" href="#footnote-7">[7]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It may sound as if Einstein believed that the soundness of
    our theories is a matter of faith.
    In fact, Einstein was quite comfortable with putting it
    exactly that way:
    <blockquote>However, it must be admitted
    that our knowledge of these laws is only imperfect
    and fragmentary, so that,
    actually the belief
    in the existence of basic all-embracing laws
    in Nature also rests on a sort of faith.
    All the same this faith has been largely
    justified so far by the success of
    scientific research. &mdash; Einstein <a id="footnote-8-ref" href="#footnote-8">[8]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    I believe that every true theorist
    is a kind of tamed metaphysicist,
    no matter how pure a "positivist" he may
    fancy himself.
    The metaphysicist believes that the logically
    simple is also the real.
    The tamed metaphysicist believes
    that not all that is logically simple
    is embodied in experienced reality,
    but that the totality of all sensory experience
    can be "comprehended" on the basis of a
    conceptual system built on premises of great
    simplicity.
    The skeptic will say this is a "miracle creed."
    Admittedly so, but it is a miracle creed
    which has been borne out to an amazing extent by
    the development of science. &mdash; Einstein <a id="footnote-9-ref" href="#footnote-9">[9]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    The liberty of choice, however,
    is of a special kind;
    it is not in any way similar to the liberty of a
    writer of fiction.
    Rather, it is similar to that of a man engaged
    in solving a well-designed puzzle.
    He may, it is true, propose
    any word as the solution;
    but, there is only <i>one</i>
    word which really solves the puzzle in all its
    parts.
    It is a matter of faith that nature
    &mdash;
    as she is perceptible to our five senses
    &mdash;
    takes the character of such a
    well-formulated puzzle.
    The successes reaped up to now
    by science do,
    it is true,
    give a certain encouragement for this faith. --
    Einstein <a id="footnote-10-ref" href="#footnote-10">[10]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The puzzle metaphor of the last quote is revealing.
    Einstein believes there is a single truth,
    but that we will never know what it is &mdash;
    even its existence can only be taken as a matter of faith.
    Existence is a crossword puzzle whose answer we will never
    know.
    Even the existence of an answer must be taken as
    a matter of faith.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    The very fact that the totality of our sense experience
    is such that by means of thinking
    (operations with concepts,
    and the creation and use of definite functional relations
    between them,
    and the coordination of sense experiences to these concepts)
    it can be put in order,
    this fact is one which leaves us in awe,
    but which we shall never understand.
    One may say that
    "the eternal mystery of the world
    is its comprehensibility". &mdash; Einstein <a id="footnote-11-ref" href="#footnote-11">[11]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    In my opinion,
    nothing can be said <i>a priori</i>
    concerning the manner in which the concepts
    are to be formed and connected,
    and how we are to coordinate them to sense experiences.
    In guiding us in the creation of such an order
    of sense experiences,
    success alone is the determining factor.
    All that is necessary is to fix a set of rules,
    since without such rules the acquisition
    of knowledge in the desired sense would be impossible.
    One may compare these rules with the rules of a game
    in which,
    while the rules themselves are arbitrary,
    it is their rigidity alone which
    makes the game possible.
    However, the fixation will never be final.
    It will have validity only for a special field
    of application. &mdash; Einstein <a id="footnote-12-ref" href="#footnote-12">[12]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    There are no eternal theories in science.
    It always happens that some of the facts
    predicted by a theory
    are disproved by experiment.
    Every theory has its period of
    gradual development and triumph,
    after which it may experience a
    rapid decline. &mdash; Einstein and Infeld
    <a id="footnote-13-ref" href="#footnote-13">[13]</a>
    </blockquote>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    In our great mystery story there are no problems
    wholly solved and settled for all time. &mdash; Einstein and Infeld
    <a id="footnote-14-ref" href="#footnote-14">[14]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      This great mystery story
      is still
      unsolved.
      We
      cannot
      even be sure that it has a final solution. &mdash;
      Einstein and Infeld <a id="footnote-15-ref" href="#footnote-15">[15]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Choosing a "highway"</h2>
    In most of the above,
    Einstein is focusing on his work in a "hard" science: physics.
    Are his methods relevant to "softer" fields of study?
    Einstein thinks so:
    <blockquote>
      The whole of science is nothing
      more than a refinement of everyday thinking.
      It is for this reason that the critical thinking
      of the physicist cannot possibly be restricted to
      the examination of the concepts of his own
      specific field.
      He cannot proceed without considering critically
      a much more difficult problem,
      the problem of analyzing the nature of everyday
      thinking. &mdash; Einstein
      <a id="footnote-16-ref" href="#footnote-16">[16]</a>
    </blockquote>
    Einstein's collaboration with Infeld was, like the "Timeline",
    a description of the evolution of ideas,
    and in the Einstein&ndash;Infeld book they describe their approach:
    <blockquote>
      Through the maze of
      facts and concepts we had to choose some highway
      which seemed to us most characteristic and significant.
      Facts and theories not reached by this road had to be
      omitted. We were forced, by our general aim, to make
      a definite choice of facts and ideas. The importance of a
      problem should not be judged by the number of pages
      devoted to it. Some essential lines of thought have been
      left out, not because they seemed to us unimportant,
      but because they do not lie along the road we have
      chosen. &mdash; Einstein and Infeld <a id="footnote-17-ref" href="#footnote-17">[17]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Truth and success</h2>
    <p>Einstein says that objective truth, while
    it exists, is not to be attained in the hard sciences,
    so it is not likely he thought that a historical
    account could outdo physics in this respect.
    For Einstein, as quoted above,
    "success alone is the determining factor".
    </p>
    <p>Success, of course, varies with what the audience
    for a theory wants.
    In a very real sense,
    I consider a theory that can predict the
    stock market more successful than
    one which can predict perturbations of planetary orbits
    invisible to the naked eye.
    But this is not a reasonable expectation when applied
    to the theory of general relativity.
    </p>
    Among the expectations reasonable for a timeline of parsing
    might be these:
    <ul>
    <li>It helps choose the right parsing algoithm for practical
    applications.
    <li>It helps a reader to understand articles in the
    the literature of parsing.
    <li>It helps guide future research.
    <li>It predicts the outcome of future research.
    </ul>
    </p>When I wrote the first version of <cite>Timeline</cite>,
    its goal was none of these.
    Instead I intended it to explain the sources behind my own
    research in the Earley/Leo lineage.
    </p>
    <p>
    With such a criteria of "success",
    I wondered if <cite>Timeline</cite> would have an audience
    much larger than one,
    and was quite surprised when it started getting thousands of
    web hits a day.
      The large audience <cite>Timeline 1.0</cite> drew
      was a sign that there is an large appetite
      out there for
      accounts of parsing theory,
      an appetite so strong that anything resembling
      a coherent account
      was quickly devoured.
    <p>In response to the unexpectedly large audience,
    later versions of the <cite>Timeline</cite> widened
    their focus.
      <cite>Timeline 3.1</cite>
      was broadened to give good coverage
      of mainstream parsing practice,
      including a lot of new material and original analysis.
      This brought in lot of material on topics
      which had little or no influence on my Earley/Leo work.
      The parsing of arithmetic expressions,
      for example,
      is trivial in the Earley/Leo context,
      and before my research for <cite>Timeline 3.0</cite>
      I had devoted little attention to
      approaches that I felt amounted to
      needlessly doing things the hard way.
      But arithmetic expressions are at the borderline of power
      for traditional approaches
      and parsing arithmetic expressions was a central motivation
      for the authors of the algorithms that have so far
      been most influential on mainstream parsing.
      So in
      <cite>Timeline 3.1</cite>
      arithmetic expresssions became a recurring theme,
      being brought back for detailed examination time and time again.
    </p>
    <h2>Is the "Timeline" false?</h2>
    <p>
      Is the "Timeline" false?
      The answer is yes, in three increasingly practical senses.
    </p>
    <p>As Einstein makes clear,
    every theory that is about reality,
    will eventually proved be false.
    The best a theory can hope for is the fate of
    Newton's physics &mdash;
    to be shown to be a subcase of a larger theory.
    </p>
    <p>In a more specific sense,
    the truth of any theory of parsing history depends
    on its degree of success in explaining the facts.
    This means that the truth of the "Timeline" depends on which facts
    you require it to explain.
    If arbitrary choices of facts to be explained are allowed,
    the "Timeline" will certainly be seen to be false.
    </p>But can the "Timeline" be shown to be false
    for criteria of success which are non-arbitrary?
    In the next section, I will describe four non-arbitrary
    criteria of success,
    all of which are of practical interest,
    and for all of which the "Timeline" is false.
    </p>
    <h2>The Forever Five</h2>
    <p>"Success" depends a lot on judgement,
    but my studies have led me to conclude that all but five algorithms
    are "unsuccessful" in the sense that,
    for everything that they do,
    at least one other algorithm does it better in practice.
    But this means there are five algorithms which <b>do</b> solve
    some practical problems
    better than any other algorithm,
    including each of the other four.
    I call these the "forever five" because,
    if I am correct,
    these algorithms will be of permanent interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      My "Forever Five" are regular expressions, recursive descent, PEG, Earley/Leo and Sakai's
      algorithm.<a id="footnote-18-ref" href="#footnote-18">[18]</a>
      Earley/Leo is the focus of my
      <cite>Timeline</cite>, so that an effective
      critique of my "Timeline"
      could be a parsing historiography centering on any other of the other four.
    </p>
    <p>For example, of the five, regular expressions are the most limited in parsing power.
      On the other hand, most of the parsing problems you encounter in practice,
      are handled quite nicely by regular expressions.<a id="footnote-19-ref" href="#footnote-19">[19]</a>
      Good implementations of regular expressions are widely available.
      And, for speed, they are literally unbeatable -- if a parsing problem is a
      regular expression, no other algorithm will beat a dedicated regular expression
      engine for parsing it.
    </p>
    <p>Could a
      <cite>Timeline</cite>
      competitor be written which
      centered on regular expressions?
      Certainly.
      And if immediate usefulness to the average programmer is the criterion
      (and it is a very good criterion),
      then the
      <cite>Regular Expressions Timeline</cite>
      would certainly give
      my timeline a run for the money.
    </p>
    <h2>What about a PEG Timeline?</h2>
    <p>
      The immediate impetus for this article was
      <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/marpa-parser/8EEq92TjR4E/dIzCnsITBQAJ">a very collegial inquiry</a>
      from Nicolas Laurent, a researcher whose main interest is PEG.
      Could a
      <cite>PEG Timeline</cite>
      challenge mine?
      Again, very certainly.
    </p>
    <p>Because there are at least some
      problems for which PEG is superior to everything else,
      my own Earley/Leo approach included.
      As one example, PEG,
      could be an more powerful alternative to regular expressions.
    </p>
    <p>That does not mean that I might not come back with
    a counter-critique.
    Among the questions that I might ask:
    <ul>
    <li>
      Is the PEG algorithm being proposed a future,
      or does it have an implementation?
    </li>
    <li>What claims of speed and time complexity are made?
      Is there a way of determining in advance of runtime how fast
      your algorithm will run?
      Or is the expectation of practical speed
      on an "implement and pray" basis?
    </li>
    <li>Does the proposed PEG algorithm match human parsing
      capabilities?
      If not, it is a claim for human exceptionalism,
      of a kind not usually accepted in modern computer science.
      How is exceptionalism justified in this case?
    </li>
    </ul>

        Three quibbles:
        Regular expressions do not find structure,
        so pedantically they are recognizers,
        not parsers.
        Recursive descent is technique for creating a family of algorithms,
        not an algorithm.
        The algorithm first described by Sakai is more commonly
        called CYK, from the initials of three other researchers who re-discovered
        it over the years.

      A lot of this is because programmers learn to formulate problems in
      ways which avoid complex parsing so that the alternatives are
      using regular expressions or rationalizing away the
      need for parsing.
