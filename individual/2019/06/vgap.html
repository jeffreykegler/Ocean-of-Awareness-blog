    <h2>About this post</h2>
    <p>This post presents a practical, compact example which
    demonstrates a use case for both infinite lookahead
    and Ruby Slippers parsing.
    While the example itself is very simple,
    this post may not be a good first tutorial --
    it focuses on Marpa implementation strategy,
    instead of basics.
    </p>
    <h2>About Urbit</h2>
    <p>The example described in this post is one part of
    <tt>hoonlint</tt>.
    <tt>hoonlint</tt>, currently under development,
    will be a "lint" program for a language called Hoon.
    </p>
    <p>
    Hoon is part of the Urbit project.
    Urbit is an effort to return control of the Internet
    experience to the individual user.
    (The Urbit community has, generously, been supporting my work on Hoon.)
    </p>
    <p>
    The original Internet and its predecessors were cosy places.
    Users controlled their experience.
    Authority was so light you
    could forget it was there,
    but so adequate to its task that you could forget why it
    was necessary.
    What we old timers do remember of the early Internet was the feeling of entering
    into a "brave new world".
    </p>
    <p>
The Internet grew beyond our imaginings,
and our pure wonder of decades ago now seems ridiculous.
But the price has been a shift
of power which should be no laughing matter.
Control of our Internet experience now resides in
servers,
run by entities which make no secret of having their own interests.
Less overt, but increasingly obvious, is the single-mindedness with which they pursue
those interests.
</p>
<p>
And the stakes have risen.
In the early days,
we used the Internet as a supplement in our intellectual lives.
Today, we depend on it in our financial and social lives.
Today, the server-sphere can be a hostile  place.
Going forward it may well become a theater of war.
    </p>
    We could try to solve this problem by running our own servers.
    But this is a lot of work, and only leaves us in touch with those
    willing and able to do that.  In practice, this seems to be nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
Urbit seeks to solve these problems with
hassle-free personal servers, called urbits.
Urbits are journaling databases, so they are incorruptable.
To make sure they can be run anywhere in the cloud<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>,
they are based on a tiny virtual machine, called Nock.
To keep urbits compact and secure,
Urbit takes on code bloat directly --
Urbit is a original design from a clean slate,
with a new protocol stack.
    </p>
    <h2>About Hoon</h2>
    <p>
    Nock's "machine language" takes the form of trees of arbitrary precision integers.
    The integers can be interpreted as strings, floats, etc.,
    as desired.
    And the trees can be interpreted as lists,
    giving Nock a resemblance to a LISP VM.
    Nock does its own memory management
    and takes care of its own garbage collection.<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    Traditionally, there are two ways to enter machine language,
    <ul>
    <li>Physically, for example,
    by toggling it into a machine's front panel.
    Originally, entering it physically was the only way.
    </li>
    <li>Indirectly, using
    assembler or some higher-level language, like C.
    Once these indirect methods existed, they
    rapidly took over as the most common way to create machine language.
    </li>
    </ul>
    Like traditional
    machine language, Nock cannot be written directly.
    Hoon is Urbit's equivalent of C -- it is Urbit's
    "close to the metal" higher level language.
    </p>
    <p>
    Not that Hoon looks much like C,
    or anything else you've ever seen.
    This is a Hoon program that takes an integer argument,
    call it <tt>n</tt>,
    and returns the first <tt>n</tt> counting numbers:
    <pre><tt>
    |=  end=@                                               ::  1
    =/  count=@  1                                          ::  2
    |-                                                      ::  3
    ^-  (list @)                                            ::  4
    ?:  =(end count)                                        ::  5
      ~                                                     ::  6
    :-  count                                               ::  7
    $(count (add 1 count))                                  ::  8
    </tt></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
    Hoon comments begin with a "<tt>::</tt>" and run until the next
    newline.
    The above Hoon sample uses comments to show line numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
    The example for this post will be
    a <tt>hoonlint</tt> subset: a multi-line comment linter.
    Multi-line comments are the only Hoon syntax we will talk about.
    (For those who want to know more about Hoon,
    <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/learn/hoon/">there is a tutorial</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h2>About Hoon comments</h2>
    <p>
    In basic Hoon syntax, multi-line comments are free-form.
    In practice, Hoon authors tend to follow a set of conventions.
    </p>
    <h3>Pre-comments</h3>
    <p>
    In the simplest case, a comment must precede the code it
    describes, and be at the same indent.
    These simple cases are called "pre-comments".<a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>
    For example, this code contains a pre-comment:
    <pre><tt>
	  :: pre-comment 1
	  [20 (mug bod)]
    </tt></pre>
    <p>
    <h3>Inter-comments</h3>
    Hoon multi-line comments may also
    contain "inter-comments".
    The inter-comments are aligned depending on the syntax.
    In the display below, the inter-comments are aligned with the "rune" of the enclosing sequence.
    A "rune" is Hoon's rough equivalent of a "keyword".
    Runes are always digraphs of special ASCII characters.
    The rune in the following code is
    <tt>:~</tt>,
    and the sequence it introduces
    includes pre-comments, inter-comments and meta-comments.
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
      :~  [3 7]
      ::
	  :: pre-comment 1
	  [20 (mug bod)]
      ::
	  :: pre-comment 2
	  [2 yax]
      ::
	  :: pre-comment 3
	  [2 qax]
    ::::
    ::    :: pre-comment 4
    ::    [4 qax]
      ::
	  :: pre-comment 5
	  [5 tay]
      ==
    </tt></pre>
    <p>
    When inter-comments are empty, as they are in the above,
    they are called "breathing comments", because they serve to separate,
    or allow some "air" between, elements of a sequence.
    For clarity,
    the pre-comments in the above are further indicated:
    all and only pre-comments contain the text "<tt>pre-comment</tt>".
    </p>
    <h3>Meta-comments</h3>
    <p>
    The above code also contains a third kind of comment -- meta-comments.
    Meta-comments must occur at the far left margin -- at column 1.
    These are called meta-comments, because they are allowed
    to be outside the syntax structure.
    One common use for meta-comments is "commenting out" other syntax.
    In the above display, the meta-comments "comment out"
    the comment labeled "<tt>pre-comment 4</tt>"
    and its associated code.
    </p>
    <h3>Staircase comments</h3>
    <p>Finally, there are "staircase comments", which are used
    to indicate the larger structure of Hoon sequences and other
    code.
    For example,
    <pre><tt>
    ::                                                      ::
    ::::  3e: AES encryption  (XX removed)                  ::
      ::                                                    ::
      ::
    ::                                                      ::
    ::::  3f: scrambling                                    ::
      ::                                                    ::
      ::    ob                                              ::
      ::
    </tt> </pre>
    <p>
    Each staircase consists of three parts.
    In lexical order, these parts are
    an upper riser,
    a tread, and a lower riser.
    The upper riser is a sequence of comments at the same
    alignment as an inter-comment.
    The tread is also at the inter-comment alignment,
    but must be 4 colons ("<tt>::::</tt>") followed
    by whitespace.
    The lower riser is a sequence of comments
    indented two spaces more than the tread.
    </p>
    <h2>Hoon comment conventions</h2>
    <p>Hoon's basic syntax allows comments to be free-form.
    In practice, there are strict conventions for these comments,
    conventions we would like to enforce with a <tt>lint</tt> for Hoon:
    a <tt>hoonlint</tt>.
    <ol>
    <li>A multi-line comment may contain
    an "inter-part", a "pre-part",
    or both.
    </li>
    <li>If both an inter-part and a pre-part are present,
    the inter-part must preceed the pre-part.
    </li>
    <li>The inter-part must be either
       <ul>
       <li>a sequence of one or more inter-comments; or
       </li>
       <li>a sequence of one or more staircases.
       </li>
       </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A pre-part is always a sequence of
    one or more pre-comments.
    </li>
    <li>Meta-comments may be inserted anywhere in either the pre-part
    or the inter-part.
    </li>
    <li>Comments which do not obey the above rules are
    <b>bad comments</b>.
    A <b>good comment</b> is any comment which is not a bad comment.
    </li>
    <li>A comment is not regarded as a meta-comment
    if it can be parsed as structural comment.
    An <b>structural comment</b> is any good comment which is
    not a meta-comment.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Grammar</h2>
    <p>We will implement these conventions using the BNF
    of this section.
    The sections to follow outline the strategy behind the BNF.

    Exception ::= BlankLine
    </tt></pre>
    <h2>Technique: Combinator</h2>
    Our comment linter is implemented as a combinator.
    The main <tt>hoonlint</tt> parser invokes this combinator when it encounters
    a multi-line comment.
    Because of the main parser,
    we do not have to worry about confusing comments with
    Hoon's various string and in-line text syntaxes.
    </p>
    <p>Note that while combinator parsing is useful,
    it is a technique that can be oversold.
    Combinators have been much talked about in the functional programming
    literature<a id="footnote-4-ref" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>,
    but GHC, the flagship functional programming
    language parser,
    does not use combinators to parse itself --
    instead it uses a parser in the yacc lineage.<a id="footnote-5-ref" href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>
    As a parsing technique on its own,
    the use of combinators is simply another way of packaging recursive
    descent with backtracking,
    and the two techniques share the same power,
    the same performance,
    and the same downsides.
    </p>
    <p>Marpa is much more powerful than either LALR (yacc-lineage) parsers or combinators,
    so we can save combinator parsing for those cases where
    combinator parsing really is helpful.
    One such case is lexer mismatch.
    </p>
    <h3>Lexer mismatch</h3>
    <p>The first programming languages, like BASIC and FORTRAN,
    were line-structured -- designed to be parsed line-by-line.<a id="footnote-6-ref" href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>
    After ALGOL, new languages were usually block-structured.
    Blocks can start or end in the middle of a line,
    and can span multiple lines.
    And blocks are often nested.
    </p>
    <p>A line-structured language requires its lexer to think in
    terms of lines,
    but this approach is completely useless for a block-structured
    language.
    Combining both line-structured and block-structured logic in the same lexer
    usually turns the lexer's code into a rat's nest.
    </p>
    <p>Calling a combinator every time
    a line-structured block is encountered eliminates the problem.
    The main lexer can assume that the code is block-structured,
    and all the line-by-line logic can go into combinators.
    </p>
    <h2>Technique: Non-determinism</h2>
    <p>
    Our grammar is non-deterministic,
    but unambiguous.
    It is unambiguous because,
    for every input,
    it will produce no more than one parse.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is non-deterministic because there is a case
    where it tracks two possible parses at once.
    The comment linter cannot immediately distinguish between
    the prefix of the upper riser of a staircase,
    and the prefix of a sequence of inter-comments.
    When a tread and lower riser is encountered,
    the parser knows it has found a staircase,
    but not until then.
    And if the parse is of an inter-comment sequence,
    the comment linter will
    not be sure of this until the end of the sequence.
    </p>
    <h2>Technique: Infinite lookahead</h2>
    <p>
    As just pointed out,
    the comment linter does not know whether it is parsing a staircase or
    an inter-comment sequence until either
    <ul>
    <li>it finds a tread and lower riser, in which case
    it knows the correct parse will be a staircase; or
    </li>
    <li>it successfully reaches the end of the inter-comment sequence,
    in which case it knows the correct parse is an inter-comment sequence.
    </ul>
    To determine which of these two choices is the correct parse,
    the linter needs to read
    an arbitrarily long sequence of tokens --
    in other words, the linter needs to perform infinite lookahead.
    </p>
    <p>Humans deal with infinite lookaheads all the time --
    natural languages are full of situations that require them.<a id="footnote-7-ref" href="#footnote-7">[7]</a>
    Modern language designers labor to avoid the need
    for infinite lookahead,
    but even so
    cases where it is desirable pop up.<a id="footnote-8-ref" href="#footnote-8">[8]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    Fortunately, in 1991, Joop Leo published a method that
    allows computers to emulate infinite lookahead efficiently.
    Marpa uses Joop's technique.
    Joop's algorithm is complex,
    but the basic idea is to do what humans do in the same circumstance --
    keep all the possibilities in mind until the evidence comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h2>Technique: the Ruby Slippers</h2>
    <p>Recall that, according to our conventions,
    our parser does not recognize a meta-comment unless
    no structural comment can be recognized.
    We could implement this in BNF,
    but it is much more elegant to use the Ruby Slippers.<a id="footnote-9-ref" href="#footnote-9">[9]</a>
    </p>
    <p>As those already familiar with Marpa may recall,
    the Ruby Slippers are invoked when a Marpa parser finds itself
    unable to proceed with its current set of input tokens.
    At this point, the lexer can ask the Marpa parser what token it <b>does</b> want.
    Once the lexer is told what the "wished-for" token is,
    it can concoct one, out of nowhere if necessary, and pass it to the Marpa parser,
    which then proceeds happily.
    In effect, the lexer acts like Glenda the Good Witch of Oz,
    while the Marpa parser plays the role of Dorothy.
    </p>
    <p>In our implementation, the Marpa parser, by default,
    looks only for structural comments.
    If the Marpa parser of our
    comment linter finds that the current input line is not
    a structural comment,
    the Marpa parser halts
    and tells the lexer that there is a problem.
    The lexer then asks the Marpa parser what it is looking for.
    In this case, the answer will always be the same:
    the Marpa parser will be looking for a meta-comment.
    The lexer checks to see if the current line is a comment
    starting at column 1.
    If there is a comment starting at column 1,
    the lexer tells the Marpa parser that its wish has come true --
    there is a meta-comment.
    </p>
    <p>Another way to view the Ruby Slippers is as a kind of exception
    mechanism for grammars.
    In this application, we treat inability to read an structural
    comment as an exception.
    When the exception occurs,
    if possible, we read a meta-comment.
    </p>
    <h2>Technique: Error Tokens</h2>
    <p><b>Error tokens</b> are a specialized use of the Ruby Slippers.
    The application for this parser is "linting" --
    checking that the comments follow conventions.
    As such, the main product of the parser is not the parse --
    it is the list of errors gathered along the way.
    So stopping the parser at the first error does not make sense.
    </p>
    <p>
    What is desirable is to treat all inputs as valid,
    so that the parsing always runs to the end of input,
    in the process producing a list of the errors.
    To do this, we want to set up the parser so that it reads
    special "error tokens" whenever it encounters a reportable error.
    </p>
    <p>This is perfect for the Ruby Slippers.
    If an "exception" occurs,
    as above described for meta-comments,
    but no meta-comment is available,
    we treat it as a second level exception.
    </p>
    <p>When would no meta-comment be available?
    There are two cases:
    <ul><li>The line read is a comment,
    but it does not start at column 1.
    </li>
    <li>The line read is a blank line (all whitespace).
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>On the second exception level, the current line
    will be read as either a <tt>&lt;BlankLine&gt;</tt>,
    or a <tt>&lt;BadComment&gt;</tt>.
    We know that every line must lex as either a
    <tt>&lt;BlankLine&gt;</tt>
    or a <tt>&lt;BadComment&gt;</tt> because our comment linter
    is called as a combinator,
    and the parent Marpa parser guarantees this.
    </p>
    <h2>Technique: Ambiguity</h2>
    <p>Marpa allows ambiguity,
    which could have been exploited as a technique.
    For example, in a simpler BNF than that we used above,
    it might be ambiguous whether a meta-comment belongs to an <tt>&lt;Interpart&gt;</tt>
    which immediately preceeds it;
    or a <tt>&lt;Prepart&gt;</tt> which immediately follows it.
    We could solve the dilemma by noting that it does not matter,
    so that picking one of two ambiguous parses at random will work fine.
    </p>
    <p>In the comment linter of this post,
    we decided to keep our parser unambiguous.
    This means the grammar given above is less elegant
    than it could be.<a id="footnote-10-ref" href="#footnote-10">[10]</a>
    But efficiency issues are sometimes a problem with ambiguity
    and unambiguity often avoids them.<a id="footnote-11-ref" href="#footnote-11">[11]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    Also, requiring the grammar to be unambiguous allows
    an additional check that is useful in the development phase.
    In our code we test each parse for ambiguity.
    If we find one, we know that <tt>hoonlint</tt> has a coding error.
    </p>
    <p>Some of the work in keeping
    this parser unambiguous is delegated to the lexer.
    For example,
    we used our Ruby Slippers "exception mechanism" to
    guarantee that no line is
    both a meta-comment and a structural comment.<a id="footnote-12-ref" href="#footnote-12">[12]</a>

    Garbage collection and arbitrary precision may seem too high-level
    for something considered a "machine language",
    but our concepts evolve.
    The earliest machine languages required programmers to
    write their own memory caching logic
    and to create their own floating
    point representations,
    both things we now regard as much too low-level
    to deal with even at the lowest software level.

    This post attempts to follow standard Hoon terminology, but
    for some details of Hoon's whitespace conventions,
    there is no settled terminology,
    and I have invented terms as necessary.
    The term "pre-comment" is one of those inventions.

    This is simplified.
    There were provisions for line continuation, etc.
    But, nonetheless, the lexers for these languages worked in
    terms of lines, and had no true concept of a "block".

    An example of a requirement for infinite lookahead
    is the sentence "The horse raced past the barn fell".
    Yes, this sentence is not, in fact, infinitely long,
    but the subclause "raced past the barn" could be anything,
    and therefore could be arbitrarily long.
    In isolation, this example sentence may seem unnatural,
    a contrived "garden path".
    But if you imagine the sentence as an answer to the question, "Which horse fell?",
    expectations are set so that the sentence is quite reasonable.
    And, when the two expectations are balanced,
    humans parse sentences like our "horse raced" example
    by keeping track
    of both possibilities until it becomes clear which one
    is the right one.

    One example of an extra symbol introduced to make the parser
    unambiguous is <tt>&lt;ProperPreComment&gt;</tt>,
    which is used to ensure that a
    <tt>&lt;PrePart&gt;</tt>
    never begins with a meta-comment.
 <a href="#footnote-10-ref">&#8617;</a></p>
<p id="footnote-11"><b>11.</b>
    If <tt>n</tt> meta-comments occur between a
    <tt>&lt;Interpart&gt;</tt>
    and a <tt>&lt;Prepart&gt;</tt>, the dividing line is arbitrary,
    so that there are <tt>n+1</tt> parses.
    This will, in theory, make the processing time quadratic.
    And, in fact, long sequences of meta-comments might occur
    between the inter- and pre-comments,
    so the inefficiency might be real.
 <a href="#footnote-11-ref">&#8617;</a></p>
<p id="footnote-12"><b>12.</b>
    Inter-comments and
    comments that are part of upper risers may start on line 1,
    so an ambiguity between a structural and
    a meta-comment is entirely
    possible.

    For the <tt>hoonlint</tt>-embedded form,
    the Marpa grammar is
    <a href="https://github.com/jeffreykegler/yahc/blob/714157124b46492e13968c786e400276017a3b85/Lint/Policy/Test/Whitespace.pm#L19">
    here</a>
    and the code is
    <a href="https://github.com/jeffreykegler/yahc/blob/714157124b46492e13968c786e400276017a3b85/Lint/Policy/Test/Whitespace.pm#L341">
    here</a>.
    These are snapshots -- permalinks.
    The application is under development,
    and probably will change considerably.
    In this pre-alpha embedded form, documentation and unit testing are
    lacking,
    so that this pre-alpha embedded form will mainly be useful
    for those who want to take a quick glance at the
    comment linter in context.
