    <p><b>1960</b>
      -- The ALGOL 60 spec comes out.
      It specifies, for the first time, a block structured
      language.
      The ALGOL committee is well aware
      that
      nobody knows how to parse such a language.
      But they believe that if they specify a block-structured
      language, a parser for it will be invented.
    </p><p>They turn out to be right.
      In
      <b>1961</b>, Ned Irons publishes his ALGOL parser.
      In fact, the Irons parser
      is the first parser of any kind to be described
      in print.
      Ned's algorithm was a form of recursive descent,
      but unlike modern
      recursive descent,
      the Irons algorithm
      is general and syntax-driven.
      "General" means it can parse anything written in BNF.
      "Syntax-driven" (aka declarative) means that parser is
      actually created from the BNF -- an Irons parser does not need
      to be hand-written.
    </p><p><b>1965</b>: Don Knuth invents LR parsing.
      Knuth is mainly interested
      in the mathematics.
      He describes a parsing algorithm,
      but it is not thought practical.
    </p><p><b>1968</b>: Jay Earley invents the algorithm named after him.
      Like the Irons algorithm,
      Earley's algorithm is also syntax-driven and fully general.
      Unlike the Irons algorithm, it does not backtrack.
      Earley's core idea was to
      track everything about the parse in tables.
    </p><p>
      Earley's algorithm is enticing, but it has four major issues.
      Three of these are obvious at the time:
      First, there is a bug in the handling of null productions.
      Second, it is quadratic for right recursions.
      Third, the bookkeeping required to set up the tables is,
      by the standards of 1968 hardware, daunting.
    </p><p>
      The fourth problem is that Earley's syntax-driven algorithm
      does not allow the application to switch over to
      hand-written, procedural logic.
      This problem does not seem to have been explicitly pointed
      out -- quite probably Jay Earley would have solved it if it
      had been.
      But I do believe that the problem must have been felt.
      Because by this time, most parsers are left-parsers,
      like the original Irons algorithm.
      But they are hand-written instead of syntax-driven.
      Left parsing turned out to mix well with custom hacks.
    </p><p>The textbooks continue to discuss Earley's algorithm.
      In
      <b>1972</b>, Aho and Ullmann describe
      a straightforward fix to the null-production bug in Earley's original algorithm.
      Unfortunately, this fix involves adding even more bookkeeping to Earley's.
      The search for an efficient, powerful, syntax-driven algorithm
      seem to be at a dead-end until ...
    </p><p>In
      <b>1969</b>,
      a PhD thesis by Frank DeRemer described a new variant of Knuth's LR
      parsing.
      DeRemer's LALR algorithm requires only
      a stack and a state table of quite
      manageable size.
      Gradually,
      the world takes notice.
    </p><p>In
      <b>1975</b>,
      Bell Labs converts its C compiler from hand-written recursive
      descent to DeRemer's LALR algorithm.
    </p><p>In
      <b>1977</b>,
      the first "Dragon book" comes out.
      The nickname of this classic textbooks comes from the drawing
      on the front cover, in which a knight takes on a dragon.
      Emblazoned on his lance are the letters "LALR".
      From here on,
      to speak lightly of LALR will be to besmirch the escutcheon
      of parsing theory.
    </p><p>If you want to date the high point of LALR's reign,
      a good year might be
      <b>1987</b>
      That is the year that
      Larry Wall introduced Perl 1.
      Perl embraced complexity like no previous language,
      and to do it, is used LALR very aggressively.
    </p><p>
      Earley's algorithm was largely forgotten, but not completely.
      In
      <b>1991</b>, Joop Leo discovers a way of speeding up right
      recursions in Earley's algorithm.
      While not noticed at the time, this is in fact a major discovery.
      Leo's algorithm
      is linear for just about every unambiguous grammar of
      practical interest, and many ambiguous ones as well.
      And 1991 hardware was six orders of magnitude faster
      than 1968 hardware, so the bookkeeping issue had receded
      in importance.
      But by the point Earley's parsing was very far off the radar.
      It took 20 years for anyone to write a practical
      implementation of Leo's algorithm.
    </p><p>
      So, since Earley's is forgotten, everyone in
      LALR-land is content.  Right?
      Wrong. Far from it, in fact ...
    </p><p>In
      <b>2000</b>, Larry Wall decides on a radical reimplementation
      of Perl -- Perl 6.  He does not even consider using LALR again.
      Users of LALR had made some nasty discoveries about it.
      While LALR does automatically
      generates a parser for you,
      it is so hard to debug that it's
      usually just as easy to write one by hand.
      Once written, an LALR parser is fast for correct inputs.
      But almost all it can tell the users about incorrect inputs,
      is that they are incorrect --
      the LALR tables provide little clue as to why.
      In Larry's words, LALR was "fast but stupid".
      Discontent with LALR
      was also spreading inside academia ...
    </p><p>In
      <b>2002</b>,
      Aycock&Horspool describe their attempt to speed up Earley's in practice.
      They do not include Joop Leo's improvement --
      they seem not to be aware of it.
      Their own speedup is limited in what it achieves
      and introduces complications.
      But buried in their paper is a solution to the null-production bug --
      this time a solution that requires no additional bookkeeping.
    </p><p>
      The Aycock&Horpsool has little effect on practical parsing.
      But that does little to slow LALR plummet from favor.
      completely rewritten.
      For three decades,
      the industry's flagship C compilers had been
      parsed with LALR --
      proof of the claim that LALR and serious
      parsing were equivalent.
    </p><p>But in
      <b>2006</b>, an era ends.
      GNU announces that the GCC compiler's parser has been rewritten.
      LALR's replacement is the technology that
      it replaced a quarter century earlier:
      recursive descent.
    </p><p>With the retreat from LALR comes a collapse in the
      prestige of parsing theory.
      After a half century of
      research, we seemed to have wound up where we started.
      If you took Ned Iron's original 1961 algorithm,
      filed off the names and dates,
      an republished it, it would look quite modern.
      In fact, you could easily present some of its features
      as new and ground-breaking.
    </p><p>Earley's algorithm never completely lost its ability to entice,
      and I'd come back to it again and again over the years.
      Around
      <b>2010</b>, I realized
      that the long-abandoned vision --
      an efficient, practical, general and syntax-driven parser --
      was now, in fact, quite possible.
      Over the years, unnoticed, the pieces had fallen into place.
    </p><p>
      Aycock&Hospool has solved the null-production bug.
      Joop Leo had found the speedup for right recursion.
      Machines operations were now a billion times faster than in 1968,
      which is probably irrelevant since they're no longer the best
      metric for CPU efficiency --
      caches misses are more important.
      As an issue, bookkeeping overhead had pretty much evaporated.
    </p><p>But one issue with Earley's was now more relevant than ever.
      In the 1970's programmers considered a 100% syntax-driven
      parser to be, in the language of the time, cool.
      With the experience with LALR in their collective consciousness,
      few modern programmers are prepared
      to trust a purely declarative parser.
    </p><p>
      But, in the process of combining
      the improvements from Aycock&Horspool and Leo,
      I found that the Earley's parse engine can be written so
      that it's easy to stop.
      While paused,
      you can single-step forward token by token.
      And you can resume syntax-driver parsing at any point you
      desire.
      Earley's algorithm proves not just as friendly as recursive
      descent to hand-written procedural logic, but in fact
      more friendly.
      Earley's tables contain,
      and can share with the procedural logic,
      full knowledge of the state of the
      parse so far:
      all rules recognized
      in all possible parses so far,
      and all symbols expected.
