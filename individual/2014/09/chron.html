<p>1960 -- The ALGOL 60 spec comes out.
It specifies, for the first time, a block structured
language.
As the ALGOL committee is well aware,
at this time
nobody know how to parse such a language.
<p>1961 -- Ned Irons 
publishes the first paper
ever to describe any parsing algorithm.
It's a form of recursive descent.
Ned's original variant of recursive descent is general
and syntax-driven.
General means it can parse anything written in BNF.
Syntax driven (aka declarative) means that the algorithm
creates the parser from the BNF.
<p>1965 -- Don Knuth invents LR parsing.  Knuth was mainly interested
in the mathematics, and the actual algorithms
in his paper are not thought practical.
<p>1968 -- Jay Earley invents the algorithm named after him.
It is also syntax-driven and fully general.  The core idea is to 
track everything about the parse in  tables.
In the meantime, Ned's recursive descent has evolved
into the hand-written algorithm that is familiar today.
Jay Earley's table-building is quite efficient, but the machines
of the 1960's were very slow, so that in
<p>1969 a PhD thesis by Frank DeRemer describes a variant of Knuth's LR
parsing that requires only a stack and a manageable state table,
the world takes notice.
DeRemer's LALR <b>is</b> thought of as practical,
so much so that at Bell Labs in
<p>1975 they convert their C compiler from hand-written recursive
descent to DeRemer's LALR algorithm.
LALR has also come to dominate the textbooks.  In ...
<p>1977 the first Dragon book comes out, and the knight in
the drawing on the front of this classic textbook
carries a lance with LALR emblazoned along it.
To make light of LALR is to besmirch the escutcheon
or parsing theory.
<p>Earley's algorithm is relegated to the back pages
of these texts, when it's not omitted entirely.
Earley's original algorithm had a bug, to which Aho
and Ullman's vast two volume suggests a straightforward
remedy, but this fix slows
down an algorithm
whose speed was already an issue.
<p>In 1987, Larry Wall introduces Perl,
it is parsed using LALR.
The very complex Perl 1 through 5
parsers represent a
high water mark in the application of LALR to real life.
<p>In 1991, Joop Leo discovers a way of speeding up right
recursions in Earley's algorithm.  This means that Earley's
is now linear for just about every unambiguous grammar of
practical interest, and many ambiguous ones as well.
But so badly eclipsed is Earley parsing,
that Joop's paper
attracts no practical implementations for almost 20 years.
On the other hand, there's growing discontent
in LALR-land.
<p>In 2000, Larry Wall starts work on a radical reimplementation
of Perl 6.  This time, he does not even consider an LALR.
Practitioners have discovered that, while LALR automatically
generates a parser for you, it is so hard to debug that it's
just as easy to write one by hand.
And even once written, an LALR parser, when it fails, provides
little clue as to why.
LALR has been discovered to be, in Larry's words,
"fast but stupid".
<p>2002 -- Discontent with LALR is spreading inside academia.
A much-read paper by Aho&Ullman attempts a practical speedup.
Less noticed, but more important, they discover a clever method
for handling nulls, one that finally deals with the bug in Earley's
algorithm without a speed penalty.
But this innovation is buried in the Aho&Ullman paper, and
they do not include Joop Leo's improvement -- they seem to
be unaware of it.
While widely noticed,
Aho&Ullmann has no effect on practical parsing.
But now nothing can slow the fall of LALR from favor.
In ...
<p>2006,
GNU announces that the GCC compiler's parser has been
completely rewritten.
For 3 decades, the flagship C compilers have been
parsed with LALR.
That day is now over,
and LALR
is replaced by the 1960's technology that
it originally replaced -- recursive descent.
<p>With the fall comes a fall in the
reputation of parsing theory.
The result of more than a half century of
research is exactly zero.
We are back to a world in which,
if Ned Iron's original 1961 paper were reissued,
it could easily be presented as a
ground-breaking new algorithm.
<p>2010 --
Marpa algorithm
