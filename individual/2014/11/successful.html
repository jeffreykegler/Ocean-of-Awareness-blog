    <p>What makes a parsing algorithm successful?
    By success I mean something short of "world domination".
    A parsing algorithm is a success if it secures a lasting place for solving
    a large class of parsing problems.
    And I'll use the term "parsing" broadly,
    so that a regular expression engine counts as a "parser"
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that two factors are important.
      First, does the algorithm parse a workably-defined language?
      Second, does it allow the application to intervene in the parse
      with custom code?
      The currently successful algorithms do one or the other.
      LALR parsing, which dominated parsing for decades,
      and whose rise and fall I have chronicled elsewhere,
      does neither.
    </p>
    <h3>Does the algorithm parse a workably-defined language?</h3>
    <p>By "workably-defined" I do not just mean well-defined
    in the mathematical sense,
    but something that goes beyond that.
    To be workably-defined,
    you have to be able to tell, with reasonable effort,
    whether a language is parsed in linear time by the algorithm.
    The most prominent examples of a workably defined parsers, in this sense,
    are regular expression engines.
    </p><p>
    A regular expression, in the pure sense consists of a sequence of symbols,
    usually shown by concatenation:
    <blockquote><pre>a b c</pre></blockquote>
    or a choice among sequences, usually shown by a vertical bar:
    <blockquote><pre>a | b | c</pre></blockquote>
    or a repetition of any of the, typically shown with a star:
    <blockquote><pre>a*</pre></blockquote>
    or any recursive combination of these.
    Most readers of these posts, I assume, are programmers
    who get lots of practice with regular expressions,
    to the point where they "make sense".
    With practice, you get to the point where you know one
    when you see one.
    <p>
    Prominent examples of parsers whose languages are <b>not</b>
    workably defined at those in the LALR family (yacc, bison, etc.).
    LALR is quite well-defined mathemtically,
    but even experts in parsing theory are hard put to look at
    an arbitrary grammar and determine if it is LALR.
    <p>
    Other examples of parsers whose languages are not workably
    defined are those written using recursive descent.
    Recursive descent has, in theory, a mathematically well-defined
    basis in the LL languages,
    but in practice this is not relevant, for two reasons.
    First, most recursive descent implementations do not exploit
    LL fully by using LL tables.
    Second, most implemenations extend the LL model with ad hoc
    code, code which sometimes amount to 
    switching to  other parsing strategies.
    </p>
    <h3>Does it allow the user to intervene in the parse?</a>
    <p>It is not easy for users to intervene in the processing
    of a regular expression, though some implementation attempt to
    be friendly to such efforts.
    LALR parsers are notoriously opaque, which has not
    stopped the Perl parser from trying to supplement its abilities with
    custom code, sometimes with problematic results.
