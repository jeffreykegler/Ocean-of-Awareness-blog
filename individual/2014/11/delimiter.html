    </p><p>To parse a computer languages you need to divide
      a text in that language into pieces.
      These pieces are not necessarily atomic.
      In fact, almost always at least some of the pieces are composed of other pieces.
    </p><p>
      One way for a language to identify pieces
      is to mark their boundaries with pairs of delimiters,
      where one delimiter marks the start and the other marks the end of the piece.
    </p><p>
      Delimiters, in the sense I am using the word,
      can take many forms.
      Quote marks, parentheses, curly braces and square brackets
      are all delimiters.
      Delimiters can be much more complex.
      XML and HTML tags are delimiters
      that have an complex internal structure of their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mismatching delimiters is an easy mistake to make,
      and one which traditional parsers are often poor at reporting.
      This post outlines a scaleable method for the accurate
      reporting of mismatched delimiters.
      I will illustrate the method with an example of a simple
      but useful tool --
      a utility which reports mismatched brackets.
    </p>
    <h3>The example script</h3>
    <p>The example script
      is a utility that reports mismatched brackets in the set:
    </p><blockquote><pre>
      () {} []
      </pre></blockquote><p>
      They are required to nest in the usual way.
      All other text is treated as filler, so that this utility
      will not be smart about things
      like ths strings or comments
      in your language of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because it's intended primarily for be read
      as an illustration of the technique,
      this example is kept relatively simple.
      It's simple enough that a recursive descent parser, for
      example, might be able to emulate it.
      I hope the reader will see that this technique scales to more
      complex situations,
      in a way in which a solution based on a traditional parser
      could not.
    </p>
    <h3>Error reports</h3>
    <p>
      To be truly useful,
      <tt>bracket.pl</tt>
      must report mismatches that span
      many lines,
      and it can do this.
      But single-line examples are easier to follow,
      and all the examples in this post will be contained in a one line.
      Consider the string '((([))', the
      <tt>bracket.pl</tt>'s diagnostics are:
    </p><blockquote><pre>
* Line 1, column 1: Opening '(' never closed, problem detected at end of string
((([))
^
====================
* Line 1, column 4: Missing close ], problem detected at line 1, column 5
((([))
   ^^
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      In the next example
      <tt>bracket.pl</tt>
      realizes that it
      cannot accept the ')' at column 16, without first closing the set of curly braces started at column 5.
      It identifies the problem, along with both of the locations involved.
    </p>
    <blockquote><pre>
* Line 1, column 5: Missing close }, problem detected at line 1, column 16
[({({x[]x{}x()x)})]
    ^          ^
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      So far, so good.
      But an important advantage of
      <tt>bracket.pl</tt>
      has yet to be seen.
      With most compilers, once they encounter one mismatched delimiter,
      the rest of their error messages will be useless.
      <tt>bracket.pl</tt>
      attempts to repair the damage,
      and usually succeeds well enough so that it can accurately report
      some or all of the subsequent issues.
      Consider the text
      <tt>'({]-[(}-[{)'</tt>.
      The output of
      <tt>bracket.pl</tt>
      is
    </p><blockquote><pre>
* Line 1, column 1: Missing close ), problem detected at line 1, column 3
({]-[(}-[{)
^ ^
====================
* Line 1, column 2: Missing close }, problem detected at line 1, column 3
({]-[(}-[{)
 ^^
====================
* Line 1, column 3: Missing open [
({]-[(}-[{)
  ^
====================
* Line 1, column 5: Missing close ], problem detected at line 1, column 7
({]-[(}-[{)
    ^ ^
====================
* Line 1, column 6: Missing close ), problem detected at line 1, column 7
({]-[(}-[{)
     ^^
====================
* Line 1, column 7: Missing open {
({]-[(}-[{)
      ^
====================
* Line 1, column 9: Missing close ], problem detected at line 1, column 11
({]-[(}-[{)
        ^ ^
====================
* Line 1, column 10: Missing close }, problem detected at line 1, column 11
({]-[(}-[{)
         ^^
====================
* Line 1, column 11: Missing open (
({]-[(}-[{)
          ^
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>Each time,
      <tt>bracket.pl</tt>
      corrects itself,
      so that it can accurately spot the later problems.
    </p><h3>A difficult error report</h3>
    <p>
      The magic does not always work.
      To be 100%,
      <tt>bracket.pl</tt>
      would have to guess the programmer's intent,
      and this is of course not possible.
      Let's look at a text where
      <tt>bracket.pl</tt>'s guesses are not so good as in the cases above:
      <tt>{{]}</tt>.
      Here we will assume the closing square bracket is a typo for a closing parenthesis.
      <tt>bracket.pl</tt>
      does not guess this.
      Here's the result:
    </p><blockquote><pre>
* Line 1, column 1: Missing close }, problem detected at line 1, column 3
{{]}
^ ^
====================
* Line 1, column 2: Missing close }, problem detected at line 1, column 3
{{]}
 ^^
====================
* Line 1, column 3: Missing open [
{{]}
  ^
====================
* Line 1, column 4: Missing open {
{{]}
   ^
</pre></blockquote><p>
      Instead of one error,
      <tt>bracket.pl</tt>
      finds four.
    </p><p>
      But even in this case, the method is fairly good, especially when
      compared with current practice.
      The problem is at line 1, column 3,
      and the first three messages all identify this as one of their two
      potential problem locations.
      It is reasonable to believe that a programmer, especially once
      he becomes used to this kind of mismatch reporting,
      will quickly find the first mismatch and fix it.
      This may not be much better than the state of the art,
      but it is certainly no worse.
    </p><h3>How it works</h3>
    <p>
      Marpa is left-eidetic --
      it knows everything about the parse to the left of the current position, and the utility exploits this.
      It works using the Ruby Slippers.
      t uses the new rejection events to stop parsing whenever the parser rejects all lexemes, so that the application can dummy up a new "Ruby Slippers" token.
      It makes its best guess as to how to correct the problem and proceeds.
      This makes the parse "self-correcting",
      allowing the utility to accurately diagnose a series of mismatched parentheses.
      Traditional parsers are usually hopeless after the first mismatch, and not any too clever about the first one.
    </p>
    <h3>Implications</h3>
    <p>
      While this utility is already useful, I think of it as a prototype for what could be done.
      This problem -- matching delimiters --
      is in fact very general, and I believe these techniques have very wide application.
