    <h3>Linear?</h3>
    <p>I have claimed that my new parser,
      <a href="http://savage.net.au/Marpa.html">Marpa</a>,
      is linear for vast classes of grammars,
      going well beyond what the traditional parsers can do.
      But skepticism is justified.
      When it comes to parsing algorithms,
      there have been a lot of time complexity claims
      that are hand-wavy, misleading or just
      plain false.
      This post describes how someone,
      who
      is exercising the appropriate degree of skepticism,
      might conclude that believing Marpa's claims is a reasonable
      and prudent thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marpa's linearity claims seem to be,
      in comparison with the other parsers in practical use
      today,
      bold.
      Marpa claims linearity,
      not just for every class of grammar for which
      yacc/bison, PEG and recursive descent currently claim linearity,
      but for considerably more.
      (The mathematical details of these claims
      are in a
      <a href="#DETAILS">section at the end</a>.)
      It seems too good to be true.
    </p>
    <h3>Why should I believe you?</h3>
    <p>The most important thing to realize,
      in assessing the believability of Marpa's time complexity claims,
      is that they are not new.
      They were already proved in a long-accepted paper in the refereed literature.
      They are the time complexity claims proved by Joop Leo for his algorithm
      in 1991, over two decades ago.
      Marpa is derived from Leo's algorithm, and its time complexity claims
      are those proved for Leo's algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>Above I said that Marpa's time complexity claims "seem" bold.
      On any objective assessment, they are in fact a bit of a yawn.
      The claims
      <b>seem</b>
      surprising only because a lot of people
      are unaware of Leo's results.
      That is, they are surprising in the same sense that someone who
      had avoided hearing about radio waves would be surprised
      to learn that he can
      communicate instantly
      with someone on the other side of the world.
    </p>
    <p>So, if there's so little to prove, why does the
      <a href="https://www.academia.edu/10341474/Marpa_A_practical_general_parser_the_recognizer">
        Marpa paper</a>
      have proofs?
      In Marpa, I made many implementation decisions about,
      and some changes to, the Leo/Earley algorithm.
      None of my changes produced better time complexity results --
      my only claim is that I did not change the Leo/Earley
      algorithm in a way that slowed it down.
      To convince myself of this claim, I reworked
      the original proofs of
      Leo and Earley,
      changing them to reflect my changes,
      and demonstrated that the results
      that Leo had obtained still held.
    </p>
    <p>Proofs of this kind,
      which introduce no new mathematical techniques,
      but simply take a previous result and march from
      here to there by well-know means,
      are called "tedious".
      In journals, where there's a need to conserve space,
      they are usually omitted,
      especially if,
      as is the case with Marpa's time complexity proofs,
      the results are intuitively quite plausible.
    </p>
    <h3>Getting from plausible to near-certain</h3>
    <p>So let's say you are not going to work through every line
      of Marpa's admittedly tedious proofs.
      We've seen that the results are intuitively plausible,
      as long as you don't reject the previous literature.
      But can we do better than merely "plausible"?
    </p><p>As an aside, many people misunderstand the phrase
      "mathematically proven", especially as it applies to branches
      of math like parsing theory.
      The fact is that proofs in papers often contain errors.
      Usually these are minor,
      and don't affect the result.
      On the other hand, Jay Earley's paper,
      while one of the best Computer Science papers ever published,
      also contained a very
      serious error.
      And this error slipped past his Ph.D. committee and
      his referees.
      Mathematical arguments and proofs do not allow us to achieve
      absolute certainty.
      They can only improve the degree of certainty.
    </p>
    <p>There's a second way to dramatically increase
      your degree of conviction
      in Marpa's linearity claims, and it is quite simple.
      Create examples of problematic grammars,
      run them and time them.
      This is not as satisfying as a mathematical proof,
      because no set of test grammars can be exhaustive.
      But if you can't find a counter-example
      to Marpa's linearity claims among the grammars of
      most interest to you,
      that should help lift
      your level of certainty to "certain for
      all practical purposes".
    </p>
    <p>Much of this increase in certainty can be
      achieved without bothering to run your own tests.
      Marpa is in wide use at this point.
      If Marpa was going quadratic on grammars
      for which it claimed to be linear,
      and these were grammars of practical interest,
      that would very likely have been noticed by now.
    </p>
    <h3>I'm still not convinced</h3>
    <p>Let's suppose all this has not brought you to
      the level of certainty you need to use Marpa.
      That means the reasonable thing is to continue to
      struggle to work with the restrictions of the
      traditional algorithms, right?
      No, absolutely not.
    </p>
    <p>OK, so you don't believe that Marpa preserves
      the advances in power and speed made by Leo.
      Does that mean that parsers have to stay underpowered?
      No, it simply means that there should be a
      more direct implementation of Leo's 1991,
      bypassing Marpa.
    </p><p>But if you are looking for an implementation of Leo's
      1991 algorithm,
      I think you may end up coming back to Marpa as the most
      reasonable choice.
      Marpa's additional features
      include the ability to use custom,
      procedural logic,
      as you can with recursive descent.
      And Marpa has worked out a lot of the
      implementation details for you.

    <h3>Appendix: Some technical details</h3>
    <p>
      <a name="DETAILS">Above</a>
      I talked about algorithms, classes of grammars and their
      linearity claims.
      I didn't give details because most folks aren't interested.
      For those who are, they are in this section.
    </p>
    <p>
      yacc is linear for a grammar class called LALR,
      which is a subset of another grammar class
      called LR(1).
      If you are willing to hassle with GLR,
      bison claims linearity for all of LR(1).
      Recursive descent is a technique, not an algorithm,
      but it is top-down with look-ahead,
      and therefore can be seen as some form of LL(k),
      where k depends on how it is implemented.
      In practice, I suspect k is never much bigger than 3,
      and usually pretty close to 1.
      With packratting,
      PEG can be made linear for everything it
      parses but there is a catch --
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2015/03/peg.html">
        only in limited cases do you know
        what language your PEG grammar actually parses</a>.
      In current practice, that means your PEG grammar
      must be LL(1).
      Some of the PEG literature looks at techniques for
      extending this as far as LL-regular, but there are no
      implementations, and it remains to be seen if the
      algorithms described are practical.
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <a href="https://www.academia.edu/10341474/Marpa_A_practical_general_parser_the_recognizer">
        Marpa paper</a>
      contains a proof,
      based on a proof of the same claim by
      Joop Leo,
      that Marpa is linear for LR-regular grammars.
      The LR-regular grammars
      include the LR(k) grammars for every k.
      So Marpa is linear for LR(1), LR(2), LR(8675309), etc.
      LR-regular also includes LL-regular.
      So every class of grammar under discussion
      in the PEG literature is
      already parsed in linear time by Marpa.
      From this,
      it is also safe to conclude that,
      if a grammar can be parsed by
      anything reasonably described as recursive descent,
      it can be parsed in linear time by Marpa.
