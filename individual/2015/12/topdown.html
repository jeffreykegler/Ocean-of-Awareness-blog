      Top-down parsing is guessing.  Literally.
      Bottom-up parsing is looking.
    </p>
    <p>The way you'll often hear that phrased is that top-down parsing is
      looking, starting at the top,
      and bottom-up parsing is looking, starting at the bottom.
      But that is misleading, because the input is at the bottom --
      at the top there is nothing to look at.
      A useable top-down parser
      <b>must</b>
      have a bottom-up component,
      even if that component is just lookahead.
    </p>
    <p>A more generous, but still accurate, way to describe the top-down
      component of parsers is "prediction".
      And prediction is, indeed, a very useful component of a parser,
      when used in combination with other techniques.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, if a parser does nothing but predict,
    it can predict only one input.
      Top-down parsing must always be combined with a bottom-up
      component.
      This bottom-up component may be as modest as lookahead, but it
      <b>must</b>
      be there or else top-down parsing is really not parsing at all.
    </p>
    <h2>So why is top-down parsing used so much?</h2>
    <p>Top-down parsing may be unuseable in its pure form,
      but from one point of view that is irrelevant.
      Top-down parsing's biggest advantage is that it is highly flexible --
      there's no reason to stick to its "pure" form.
    </p>
    <p>A top-down parser can be written as a series of subroutine calls --
      a technique called recursive descent.
      Recursive descent
      allows you to hook in custom-written bottom-up logic at every
      top-down choice point,
      and it is a technique which is
      completely understandable to programmers with little or no training
      in parsing theory.
      When dealing with recursive descent parsers,
      it is more useful to be a seasoned, far-thinking programmer
      than it is to be a mathematician.
      This makes recursive descent very appealing to
      seasoned, far-thinking programmers,
      and they are the audience that counts.
    </p>
    <h2>Switching techniques</h2>
    <p>You can even use the flexibility of top-down to switch
      away from top-down parsing.
      For example, you could claim that a top-down parser could do anything my
      own parser
      (<a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Marpa-web-site/">Marpa</a>)
      could do, because a recursive descent parser can call
      a Marpa parser.
    </p>
    <p>
      A less dramatic switchoff, and one that still leaves the parser with a good claim to be
      basically top-down, is very common.
      Arithmetic expressions are essential for a computer language.
      But they are also
      among the many things
      top-down parsing cannot handle, even with ordinary lookahead.
      Even so, most computer languages these days are parsed top-down --
      by recursive descent.
      These recursive descent parsers deal with expressions
      by temporarily handing control over to an operator
      precedence parser.
      Neither of these parsers is
      extremely smart about the hand-over and hand-back
      -- it is up to the programmer to make sure the two play together nicely.
      But used with caution, this approach works.
    </p>
    <h2>Top-down parsing and language-oriented programming</h2>
    <p>In past, and probably in future, posts, I've argued that,
      when it comes to advancing into new territory,
      top-down techniques simply do not have the horsepower.
      Starting from a basis of top-down parsing is literally starting
      with nothing.
      If you also attempt to adopt top-down to syntax-driven methods,
      then you also move away from of the flexibility that is top-down's greatest
      strength.
    </p>
    <p>Perl 6 grammars are top-down -- PEG with extensions,
      including backtracking, backtracking control,
      a new style of tie-breaking and lots of opportunity
      for the programmer to intervene and customize everything.
      But behind it all is a top-down parse engine.
    </p>
    <p>One aspect of Perl 6 grammars might be seen as breaking
      out of the top-down trap.
      That trick of switching over to a
      bottom-up operator precedence parser for expressions,
      which I mentioned above,
      is built into Perl 6 and automated.
      This, as far as I know, is a new feature in top-down parsers.
    </p>
    <p>But, while the new syntax may prove handy for duplicating what is done
      in recursive descent parsers,
      it adds nothing to the techniques they are already using.
      Making sure the two levels of parsing "play nice"
      with each other is still up to the programmer,
      who must either stick to the tried and true,
      or experiment very carefully.
      And features
      like
      <ul>
      <li>mulitple kinds of expression, which can be told apart
      based on their context,</li>
      <li>n-ary expressions for arbitrary n, and</li>
      <li>the autogeneration of multiple rules, each allowing
      a different precedence scheme for
      expressions of arbitrary arity and associativity,
      </ul>
      all of which are available and in current use in
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Marpa-web-site/">Marpa</a>,
      are impossible for the technology behind Perl 6 grammars.
    </p>
    <p>I am a fan of the Perl 6 effort.
      Obviously, I have doubts about one specific set of hopes for Perl 6 grammars.
      But these hopes have not been central to the Perl 6 effort,
      and I will be an eager student of the Perl 6 team's work over the coming months.
