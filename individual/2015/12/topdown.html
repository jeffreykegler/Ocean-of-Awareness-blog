    Top-down parsing is guessing.  Literally.
    Bottom-up parsing is looking.
    </p>
    <p>The way you'll often hear that phrased is that top-down parsing is
    looking, starting at the top,
    and bottom-up parsing is looking, starting at the bottom.
    But that is misleading, because the input is at the bottom --
    at the top there is nothing to look at.
    <p>A more generous, but still accurate, way to describe the top-down
    component of parsers is "prediction".
    And prediction is, indeed, a very useful component of a parser,
    when used in combination with other techniques.
    <h2>So why does top-down parsing work?</h2>
    <p>Of course, if a parser does nothing but guess, it can only parse
    exactly one input.
    So top-down parsing, in practice, is always combined with a bottom-up
    component.
    This bottom-up component may be as modest as lookahead, but it <b>must</b>
    be there or else top-down parsing is really not parsing at all.
    <p>The big advantage of the top-down structure is its flexibility.
    You can write a top-down parser as a series of subroutine calls --
    a technique called recursive descent --
    and this allows you to hook in custom-written bottom-up logic at every
    top-down choice point.
    <p>A major advantage of the recursive descent approach is that it is
    completely understandable for ordinary programmers.
    To be sure, recursive descent parsers get very large and confusing,
    but the size and confusion are of a kind where the mathematician has
    no advantage over the seasoned, far-thinking programmer.
    <h2>Advanced approaches to top-down</h2>
    <p>Many of the best minds in the field have tried to improve top-down parsing.
    But as we've seen, they are literally starting with nothing.
    And, as they move over to a more syntax-driven approach, they move
    away from the flexibility of recursive descent.
    <p>I've dealt with PEG here and here.
    The PEG syntax presents an alluring vision -- a perfect meld of regular expressions
    and BNF.
    Combined with an underlying magic that delivered the best of both,
    this would be the one parsing technique to rule them all.
    Alas, the combination 
    <h2>Perl 6</h2>
    <p>I'm a fan of the Perl 6 effort.
      I certainly
      <b>should</b>
      be a supporter, after the many favors they've done for me
      and the Marpa community over the years.
      The considerations of this post
      will disappoint some of the
      hopes for applications of the native Perl 6 parser.
      But these applications have not been central to the Perl 6 effort,
      of which I will be an eager student over the coming months.
