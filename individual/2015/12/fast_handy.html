    <p>A recent Perl 6 advent post presented a very nice vision of
      a future of language-driven programming, one I share.
      It goes on to encourage that its readers to follow up on this vision.
      However,
      I do not think the specific approach that it suggests would be fruitful.
      In this post I'll explain why.
    </p>
    <h2>Composability</h2>
    <p>I will talk about language-driven programming at some point,
      but the points I want to make will be easier to make if I make them
      in terms of another aspect of the vision from the advent post presents
      -- grammar composibility.
      Grammar composibility is nothing but "reuse" in the language-driven programming context.
      Most programmers will be very familiar with it from regular expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the regular expression world reuse is very much both practical and practiced --
      the culture of reuse is so strong there is
      is even a backlash against what some writers call "cargo cult programming".
    </p>
    <p>
      Composability is the ability to take two grammars, or pieces of grammars,
      and to put them together ("compose" them).
      In this post, I will treat both regular expressions and BNF as ways of representing the
      grammar of a language.
      Ideally, when you compose two grammars will parse
    </p><ul>
      <li>a language you can reasonably predict, that is also
      </li>
      <li>the language you can intuitively expect from a composition, and
      </li>
      <li>if each of the two grammars can be parsed in reasonable time,
        the composed language can also be parsed in reasonable time.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Not all language representation are composabile.
      Regular expressions are, and BNF is.
      PEG, which looks like a combination of BNF and regular expressions,
      is in fact, neither, and is in fact, among all the ways commonly used
      to represent language, perhaps the least composable.
    </p>
    <h2>Composing regular expressions</h2>
    <p>We'll start with regular expressions, which are as well-behaved under
      composition as a language representation can get.
      The combination of two regular expressions is always another regular expression,
      and is always exactly the one described by the combined regular expression.
      Further, every regular expression is parseable in linear time.
    </p>
    <p>The one downside, oft mentioned by critics, is that regular expression
      do not scale in terms of readability.
      Here, however, the problem is not really one of composability.
      The problem is that regular expressions are quite limited in their capabilities,
      and programmers often use their excellent behavior under composability
      to extent regular expressions to tasks for which they are not well-adopted.
    </p>
    <h2>PEG, Perl 6 grammars and composability</h2>
    <p>When programmers first look at PEG syntax, they often think they've encountered
      paradise. They see both BNF and regular expressions, and imagine they'll have the
      best of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the convenient behavior of
      regular expressions depends on their ambiguity -- you simply cannot write
      an ambiguous regular expression -- it's impossible.
      More powerful and more flexible, BNF allows you to describe many more grammars --
      including ambiguous ones.
    </p>
    <p>How does PEG resolve this?  With a Gordian knot approach.
      Whenever it encounters an ambiguity, it throws all but one of the choices away.
    </p>
    <p>TODO</p>
