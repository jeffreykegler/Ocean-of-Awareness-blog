    </p>
    <p>Every year the Perl 6 community creates an "Advent" series of posts.
      I usually follow these, but
      <a href="https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2015/12/08/day-8-grammars-generating-grammars/">one
        in particular</a>
      caught my attention this year.
      It presents a vision of a future where programming is language-driven.
      A vision that I share.
      The post went on to encourage that its readers to follow up on this vision,
      and suggested an approach.
      But I do not think the particular approach suggested would be fruitful.
      In this post I'll start to explain why.
    </p>
    <h2>Reuse</h2>
    <p>The focus of the Advent post was language-driven programming,
      and that is the aspect that excites me most.
      But the points that wish to make are probably more easily understand if
      I root them in more familiar ground
      -- grammar reuse.
    </p><p>
      Most programmers will be very familiar with grammar reuse from regular expressions.
      In the regular expression ("RE") world programming by cutting and pasting
      is very practical and often practiced --
      so much so that there
      is even a backlash against what some writers call "cargo cult programming".
    </p>
    <p>
      For this post I will consider grammar reusability to be the ability
      to join two grammars and create a third.
      This is also sometimes called grammar composition.
      I will use the term "grammar" somewhat loosely,
      and include RE's and PEG descriptions
      among the things that I call "grammars".
      Ideally, when you compose two grammars, the result will be
    </p><ul>
      <li>a language you can reasonably predict,
      </li>
      <li>and, if each of the two original grammars can be parsed in reasonable time,
        a language that can be parsed in reasonable time.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Not all language representations are reusable.
      RE's are, and BNF is.
      PEG looks like a combination of BNF and RE's.
      But PEG, in fact, is a very special form of parser specification.
      And PEG parser specifications are
      one of the least reusable language representations ever invented.
    </p>
    <h2>Reuse and regular expressions</h2>
    <p>We'll start with RE's, which are as well-behaved under
      reuse as a language representation can get.
      The combination of two RE's is always another RE,
      and you can reasonably determine what language the combined RE recognizes by
      examining it.
      Further, every RE is parseable in linear time.
    </p>
    <p>The one downside, often mentioned by critics, is that RE's
      do not scale in terms of readability.
      Here, however, the problem is not really one of reusability.
      The problem is that RE's are quite limited in their capabilities,
      and programmers often exploit the excellent behavior of RE's under reuse
      to push them into applications for which RE's just do not have the power.
    </p>
    <h2>Reuse and PEG</h2>
    <p>When programmers first look at PEG syntax, they often think they've encountered
      paradise. They see both BNF and RE's, and imagine they'll have the
      best of each.
      But the convenient behavior of
      RE's depends on their ambiguity.
      You simply cannot write
      an ambiguous RE -- it's impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      More powerful and more flexible, BNF allows you to describe many more grammars --
      including ambiguous ones.
      How does PEG resolve this?  With a Gordian knot approach.
      Whenever it encounters an ambiguity, it throws all but one of the choices away.
      The author of the PEG description gets some control over which choice is thrown away --
      he specifies an order of preference for the choices.
      But degree of control is less than it seems,
      and in practice PEG grammars have all
      the predictability of nitroglycerin.
    </p><p>
      Consider these two PEG grammars:
    </p><blockquote><pre>
	 ("a"|"aa")"a"
	 ("aa"|"a")"a"
       </pre></blockquote><p>
      One accepts "aaa" but not "aa".  The other does the reverse.
      Which one?
      For the answer to this, a discussion of which classes of grammar
      <b>are</b>
      predictable for PEG, and more,
      look at
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2015/03/peg.html">
        my previous post on PEG</a>.
    </p>
    <p>For practical grammars, using even one PEG grammar
      means giving up on knowing more much about the language you are actually parsing
      than that you got it to pass your test suite.
      Combining two PEG grammars is rolling the dice.
    </p>
    <h2>Reuse and the native Perl 6 parser</h2>
    <p>
      The native Perl 6 parser, is an extended PEG parser.
      These extensions are very interesting from the PEG point of view.
      The PEG "tie breaking" has been changed,
      and backtracking can be used.
      These features mean the Perl 6 parser can be extended to languages
      well beyond what
      ordinary PEG parsers cannot handle.
      But, if you use the extra features, reuse will be even trickier than
      if you stuck with vanilla PEG.
    </p>
    <h2>Reuse and general BNF parsing</h2>
    <p>
      As mentioned, general BNF is reusable, and so general BNF parsers like Marpa
      are as reusable as regular expressions, with two caveats.
      First, if the two grammars are not doing their own lexing, their lexers will have
      to be compatible.
    </p>
    <p>Second,
      with regular expressions you had the advantage that
      <b>every</b>
      regular expression parses in linear time, so that speed was guaranteed to be acceptable.
      Marpa users reuse grammars and pieces of grammars all the time.
      The result is always the language specified by the merged BNF,
      and I've never heard anyone complain that performance deterioriated.
    </p><p>
      But, while it may not happen often,
      it is possible to combine two Marpa grammars that run in linear time
      and end up with one that does not.
      You can guarantee your merged Marpa grammar will stay linear if you follow 2 rules:
    </p><ul>
      <li>keep the grammar unambiguous;</li>
      <li>don't use an unmarked middle recursion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Unmarked middle recursions are not things you're likely to need a lot: they
      are those palindromes where you have to count to find the middle:
      grammars like "<tt>A ::= a | a A a</tt>".
      If you do use a middle recursions at all, it is almost certainly going to
      be marked, like "<tt>A ::= b | a A a</tt>",
      which generates strings like "<tt>aabaa</tt>".
      With Marpa, as with RE's, resuse is easy and practical.
      And, as I hope to show in a future post, unlike RE's,
      Marpa opens the road to language-driven programming.
    </p>
    <h2>Perl 6</h2>
    <p>I'd like to emphasize that I'm a fan of the Perl 6 effort.
      I certainly
      <b>should</b>
      be a supporter, after the many favors they've done for me
      and the Marpa community over the years.
      If the points of this post are taken,
      they will disappoint some of the
      hopes for applications of the native Perl 6 parser.
      But these applications have not been central to the Perl 6 effort,
      of which I will be an eager student over the coming months.
