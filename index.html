</center>
  <p>
      <!--
      marpa_r2_html_fmt --no-added-tag-comment --no-ws-ok-after-start-tag
      -->
      Jean-Damien Durand has written a very ambitious application of Marpa:
      A tool which parses C language into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
      Recently released, it has been tested against
      Perl's C source code, as well as Marpa's own C source file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Potential uses of MarpaX::Languages::C::AST includes tools, interpreters
      and compilers for the C language.
      This code is open source, and is much easier basis on which
      to create C language supersets and subsets than
      previous C parsers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A C parser can take one of two strategies: approximate or precise.
      A compiler has, of course, to be precise.
      Tools, such as cross-referencers, often decide to be approximate, or sloppy.
      Sloppiness is easier to implement and has other advantages:
      Compilers require the user to get all the C flags right.
      A sloppy tool can tolerate missing flags: what the flags should be
      can be one of the things it guesses at.
    </p>
    <p>Of the two strategies, Jean-Damien decided to go with "precise".
      MarpaX::Languages::C::AST follows the C11 standard,
      with either GCC or Microsoft extensions.
      This has the advantage that
      MarpaX::Languages::C::AST could be used as the front end of a compiler.
    </p>
    <h3>A sample app: checking for violations of reserved namespace</h3>
    <p>To help check out MarpaX::Languges::C::AST, Jean-Damien created a tool which spots
      use of C reserved names.
      When many of the C language namespace decisions were made,
      namespace management was less well understood than it is now.
      Some of the restrictions are, frankly, annoying.
      Since standard diagnostics often do not report violations of them,
      reserved namespace violations are often ignored.
    (The namespace restrictions imposed by the basic C and POSIX C Libary standards are
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Reserved-Names.html">
        conveniently
        collected in GNU's manual for its libc library</a>).
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>Ignored or not, the issue is serious -- namespace violations in
    currenly working code could cause it to break when ported, or when its environment
    is upgraded.
      Consider, as an example, this reservation of namespace:
    </p><blockquote>Additional
      macro definitions, beginning with
      <b>E</b>
      and a digit or
      <b>E</b>
      and an uppercase
      letter, may also be specified by the implementation.
    </blockquote><p>
      Any implementation is free to define a new error code, say
      <tt>EIM</tt>
      for
      "Error you never IMagined would be defined".
      Whether or not an implementation defines
      <tt>EIM</tt>
      as an error code, the standards leave the result of an program's re-appropriation
      of it "undefined".
      In the C standards, "undefined" is used in a special way,
      and not a nice one.
      "Undefined" behaviors mean the implementation can break
      "break" in any way that it finds convenient, with or
      without notice.
      Using
      <tt>#undef</tt>
      is no help here.
      The result of an "<tt>#undef EIM</tt>" is also undefined.
    </p>
    <p>As an aside, the standards committee did not do this out of malevolence.
      They wanted to allow
      optimized implementations of
      elements in the reserved namespace.
      If a compiler that is allowed to assume
      that a programmer has not commandeered the reserved namespace for his own uses,
      it can be much more aggressive in its optimizations.
    </p>
    <p>I've been aware of these namespace issues for some time, but the list of this is
      long and complicated, and there are no diagnostics
      for violations of them.
      I suspected some has slipped into Marpa's 21,000 plus lines of C code.
      Some had.
    </p>
    <p>
      My implementation of Earley's algorithm requires many types and it is convenient to have short
      abbreviations for things like Earley items and Earley sets.
      <tt>EIM</tt>
      and
      <tt>ES</tt>
      seemed like great choices.
      But of course they violate the error code namespace.
      (I told you these restrictions could be annoying.)
    </p>
    <p>Also flagged as violations by Jean-Damien's utility were the variable names
      <tt>top_of_stack</tt>
      and
      <tt>token_type</tt>:
      "Function names that begin with either
      <tt>is</tt>
      or
      <tt>to</tt>,
      and a lowercase letter" are also reserved.
      That means that I had also transgressed by using
      <tt>isy_count</tt>
      and
      <tt>isy_by_right_isy_matrix</tt>.
      ("isy" is my short abbreviation for "internal symbol", and the last variable name shows why I need to use abbreviations --
      my types appear as part of other variables and they are far more readable with abbreviated type names.)
    </p>
    <p>How did the Perl 5.19.2 source fare?
      No better than Marpa's source, which appropriates these names from the reserved space:
    </p>
    <blockquote><tt>
      isa isa_changed isa_hash isa_hashes isarev isary ischop iscv isdst isg
      isio islop islv ismatchop ismodifying ismore isreg isrel isuni isutf
      todo toend token tokenbuf_len toketype tokid
      tolen too too_deep top top2 top_index top_ptr top_si topelem
      topgen_cmp topgv topmask topname
      topsv toptab tot total total_elems
    </tt></blockquote>
    <p>Another commonly misappropriated portion of the namespace reserved by the C standards is that beginning with "str",
    which is reserved for string functions by the implementation.
    This is far beyond what seems necessary, but so saith the standards,
    and Perl 5.19.2 intrudes on that namespace a few times:
    <blockquote><tt>
strbeg stream strend strict string stringarg stringok strp strpos strut
    </tt></blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p><p>And, in fact, Perl's namespace troubles get deeper than Marpa's.
      So far, the examples have only included names reserved regardless of header inclusion.
      Marpa's C code does not do IO, and it is safe to assume it never will, so Marpa is free
      to ignore, for example, the namespace reserved for
      <tt>fcntl.h</tt>.
      <tt>fnctl.h</tt>
      reserves, among other things, the namespace starting with
      <tt>S_</tt>,
      Perl has to take into account headers needed to do POSIX IO,
      but even so, the Perl source reappropriates,
      for its own purposes, 377 variables in the alphabetical range from
      <tt>S_aassign_common_vars</tt>
      to
      <tt>S_yywarn</tt>.
    </p>
    <h3>Applications</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Customized and customize-able "lints" -- programs to enforce C language standards
    and restrictions specific to a individual, a company or a project.
    </ul>
    <h3>Compilers?</h3>
    <p>
    I am focused on parsing,
    and I'm often tempted to call MarpaX::Languages::C::AST a "compiler".
    And it can be called that if you were willing to consider an abstract syntax tree
    a compilation "target".
    But much of what you look for in a compiler is missing from MarpaX::Languages::C::AST,
    including implementation of non-syntactic constraints -- things
    like "<tt>case</tt>" labels only being allowed in switch statements.
    These could be added in the same way that more conventional compilers typically implement them --
    in post-processing.
    But a central advantage of MarpaX::Languages::C::AST is to empower your own extensions --
    for you to pick up where it leaves off.

      -->
      Abstract Syntax Forests (ASF's) are my most recent project.
      I am adding ASF's to my Marpa parser.
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Marpa-web-site/">
      Marpa</a>
      has long supported ambiguous parsing,
      and allowed users to iterate through,
      and examine,
      all the parses of an ambiguous parse.
      This was enough for most applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even applications which avoid ambiguity benefit from better ways to detect
      and locate it.
      And there are applications that require the ability to select among
      and 
      manipulate very large sets of ambiguous parses.
      Prominent among these is Natural Language Processing (NLP).
      This post will introduce an experiment.
    Marpa in fact seems to have some potential for NLP.
    </p>
    <p>Writing an efficient ASF in not a simple matter.
      The naive implementation is to generate complete set
      of fully expanded abstract
      syntax trees (AST's).
      This approach consumes resources that can become
      exponential in the size of the input.
      Translation: the naive implementation quickly becomes unuseably slow.
      Marpa optimizes
      by aggressively identifying identical subtrees 
      of the AST's.
      Especially in highly ambiguous parses,
      many subtrees are identical,
      and this optimization is often a big win.
    </p>
    <h3>Ada Lovelace</h3>
    <p>
      My primary NLP example at this point
      is a quote from Ada Lovelace.
      It is a long sentence, possibly the longest, from her
      <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html">
      Notes</a> -- 158 words.
      A disadvantage of this example is that it is not typical 
      of normal NLP.
      By modern standards it is an unusually long and complex sentence.
      An advantage of it,
      and my reason for the choice,
      is that it stresses the parser.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Note A" from which this sentence is taken is
      one of Ada's notes on a translation of a paper
      on the work of her mentor and colleague, Charles Babbage.
      Ada's "Notes" are longer than the original paper,
      and far more important.
      In these "Notes" Ada makes
      the first distinction
      between a computer and a calculator,
      and between software and hardware.
      In their collaboration,
      Babbage did all of the hardware design,
      and he wrote most of the actual programs in her paper.
      But these two revolutionary ideas,
      and their elaboration, are Ada's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why would Babbage
      ignore obvious implications of his
      own invention?
      The answer is that,
      while these implications are obvious to us,
      they simply did not fit into the 1843 view of the world.
      In those days,
      algebra was leading-edge math.
      The ability to manipulate equations was considered
      an extremely advanced form of reason.
      For Babbage and his contemporaries, that sort of ability to reason
      certainly suggested the ability to distinguish between good and evil,
      and this in turn suggested possession of a soul.
      Ada's "Notes" were written 20 years after Mary Shelly,
      while visiting Ada's father in Switzerland,
      wrote
      the novel Frankenstein.
      For Ada's contemporaries,
      announcing that you planned to create a
      machine that composed music, or did
      advanced mathematical reasoning,
      was not very different
      from announcing that you planned
      to assemble a human being in your lab.
    </p>
    <p>Ada was the daughter of the poet Byron.
      For her, pushing boundaries was a family tradition.
    Babbage was happy to leave these matters to Ada.
      As
      <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/hpb.html">Babbage's son put it</a>,
      his father
    </p><blockquote>
      considered
      the Paper by Menabrea, translated with notes by Lady Lovelace,
      published in volume 3 of Taylor's 'Scientific Memoirs,"
      as quite disposing of the mathematical aspect of the invention.
      My business now is not with that.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>On reading Ada</h3>
    <p>Ada's notes are worth reading,
    but the modern reader has to be prepared to face 
      several layers of difficulty:
      <ul>
    <li>They are in Victorian English.
      In modern English, a long complex sentence is usually considered a editing failure.
      In Ada's time, following Greek and Roman examples,
      a periodic sentence was considered especially appropriate when making an important point.
      And good literary style and good scientific style were considered one and the same.
      <li>They are mathematical,
      and none of math is of the kind currently studied by programmers.
      <li>Ada has literally no prior literature on software to build on,
      and has to invent her terminology.
      It is almost never the modern terminology, and it can be hard to guess
      how it relates to modern terminology.
      For example, does Ada forsee objects, methods and classes?
        Ada speaks of computing both symbolic results and numeric data,
        and attaching one to the other.
        She clearly understands that the symbolic results can represent operations.
        Ada also clearly understands that numeric data can
        represent not just the numbers themselves,
	but notes, positions in a loom, or computer operations.
        So we have arbitrary data, tagged with symbols that can be both names and operations.
	But are these objects?
      </li>
      <li>Finally, she associates mathematics with philosophy.
      In her day, this was expected.
        Unfortunately, modern readers now often see that sort of discussion as
        irrelevant, or even as a sign of inability to come to the point.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    </p><h3>Ada's quote</h3>
    <blockquote>
      Those who view mathematical science,
      not merely as a vast body of abstract and immutable truths,
      whose intrinsic beauty,
      symmetry and logical completeness,
      when regarded in their connexion together as a whole,
      entitle them to a prominent place in the interest of all profound
      and logical minds,
      but as possessing a yet deeper interest for the human race,
      when it is remembered that this science constitutes the language
      through which alone we can adequately express the great facts of
      the natural world,
      and those unceasing changes of mutual relationship which,
      visibly or invisibly,
      consciously or unconsciously to our immediate physical perceptions,
      are interminably going on in the agencies of the creation we live amidst:
      those who thus think on mathematical truth as the instrument through
      which the weak mind of man can most effectually read his Creator's
      works,
      will regard with especial interest all that can tend to facilitate
      the translation of its principles into explicit practical forms.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Ada, the bullet point version</h3>
    <p>Ada's sentence may look like what happens
    when
      two pickups carrying out-of-date dictionaries to the landfill
      run into
      each other on the way.
      But there is, in fact,
      a good deal of structure and meaning in all those words.
      Let's take it as bullet points:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Math is awesome just for being itself.</li>
      <li>2. Math describes and predicts the external world.</li>
      <li>3. Math is the best way to get at
      what it is that is really behind existence.</li>
      <li>4. If we can do more and better math, that has to be a good thing.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      Ada is connecting her new science of software to
      the history of thought in the West,
      something which readers of the time would expect her to do.
      Bullet point 1 alludes to the Greek view of mathematics,
      especially Plato's.
      Bullet point 2 alludes to the scientific view, as pioneered by
      Galileo and Newton.
      Bullet point 3 alludes to the post-Classical world view,
      especially the Christian one.
      But while the language is Christian, Ada's idea is one that Einstein
      would have had no trouble with.
      And bullet 4 is the call to action.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we come to discuss the parse in detail,
      we'll see that it follows this structure.
      As an aside,
      note Ada's mention of "logical completeness" as one of the virtues of math.
      G&ouml;del came along nearly a century later and showed this vision,
      which went back to the Greeks, was an illusion.
      So Ada did not predict everything.
      On the other hand,
      G&ouml;del's result was also a complete surprise to Johnny von Neumann,
      who was in the room that day.
    </p>
    <h3>The experiment so far</h3>
    <p>I've gotten Marpa to grind through this sentence,
    using the same framework as
    <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/parser/">
    the Stanford NLP demo</a>.
    That demo, in fact, refuses to even attempt any sentence longer than 70 words,
    so my Ada quote needs to be broken up.
    Even on the smaller pieces,
    the Stanford demo becomes quite slow.
    Marpa, by contrast, grinds through the whole thing quickly.
    The Stanford demo is based on a CYK parser, and presumably is O(n<sup>3</sup>) -- cubic.
    Marpa seems to be exhibiting linear behavior.
    <p>Promising as this seems for Marpa,
    its first results may not hold up as the experiment gets more realistic.
    So far, I've only given Marpa enough English grammar and vocabulary to parse this one
    sentence.
    That is enough to make the grammar very complex and ambiguous,
    but even so it must be far less complex and ambiguous
    than the one behind the Stanford demo.
    Marpa will never have time worse than O(n<sup>3</sup>),
    but it's quite possible that if Marpa's grammar were as ambiguous as the Stanford one,
    Marpa would be no faster.
    Marpa, in fact, could turn out to be slower by some linear factor.
    <p>There may never be a final decision based on speed.
    Marpa might turn out to represent one approach, good for certain purposes.
    And, especially when speed is indecisive,
    other abilities can prove more important.

</center>
  <h3>The application</h3><!--
      marpa_r2_html_fmt --no-added-tag-comment --no-ws-ok-after-start-tag
--><p>
      In
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/06/mixing-procedural.html">
      a recent post</a>,
      I looked at an unusual language which serializes arrays and strings,
      using a mixture of counts and parentheses.  Here is an example:
    </p>
<blockquote><pre>
A2(A2(S3(Hey)S13(Hello, World!))S5(Ciao!))
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      The language is of special interest for comparison
      against recursive descent
      because, while simple, it requires procedural
      parsing -- a purely declarative BNF approach will not work.
      So it's a chance to find out if Marpa can play the game that is recursive descent's
      specialty.
      </p>
      <p>
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/06/mixing-procedural.html">
      The previous post</a>
      focused on how to use Marpa to mix
      procedural and declarative parsing together smoothly,
      from a coding point of view.
      It only hinted at another aspect: speed.
    Over the last year, Marpa has greatly improved its speed for this kind of application.
      The latest release of Marpa::R2 now clocks in almost 100 times faster than Parse::RecDescent for long inputs.
    </p>
    <h3>The benchmark</h3>
    <table align="center" cellpadding="5" border="1" width="100%">
      <tbody><tr><th rowspan="2">Length</th><th colspan="3">Seconds</th></tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Marpa::R2</th>
          <th>Marpa::XS</th>
          <th>Parse::RecDescent
          </th></tr>
        <tr><td>1000
          </td><td align="center">1.569
          </td><td align="center">2.938
          </td><td align="center">13.616
          </td></tr>
        <tr><td>2000
          </td><td align="center">2.746
          </td><td align="center">7.067
          </td><td align="center">62.083
          </td></tr>
        <tr><td>3000
          </td><td align="center">3.935
          </td><td align="center">13.953
          </td><td align="center">132.549
          </td></tr>
        <tr>
          <td>10000
          </td><td align="center">12.270
          </td><td align="center">121.654
          </td><td align="center">1373.171
          </td></tr>
      </tbody></table>
    <p>Parse::RecDescent is pure Perl, while Marpa is based on a parse
      engine in a library written in
      hand-optimized C.
      You'd expect Marpa to win this race and it did.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is nice to see that the changes from Marpa::XS to Marpa::R2 have paid off.
      Included in the table are the Marpa numbers from my
      2012 benchmark of Marpa::XS.
      Marpa::R2 has a new interface
      and an internal lexer,
      and now beats Marpa::XS by a factor of up to 10.
      </p>
      <p>
      While the benchmarked language is ideally suited to show recursive descent to
      advantage, the input lengths were picked to emphasize Marpa's strengths.
      Marpa optimizes by doing a lot of precomputation,
      and is written with long inputs in mind.
      Though these days, a 500K source,
      longer than the longest tested, would not exactly set a new industry record.

  <h3>Declarative and procedural parsing</h3>
    <p><!--
      marpa_r2_html_fmt --no-added-tag-comment --no-ws-ok-after-start-tag
-->A declarative parser
      takes a description of your language and parses it
      for you.
      On the face of it, this sounds like the way you'd want
      to go,
      and Marpa offers that possibility -- it generates
      a parser from anything you can write in BNF and,
      if the parser is in one of the classes currently in
      practical use,
      that parser will run in linear time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But practical grammars often have context-sensitive parts --
      features which cannot be described in BNF.
      Nice as declarative parsing may sound,
      at least
      <b>some</b>
      procedural parsing
      can be a necessity
      in real-life.
      In this post, I take a problem for which procedural
      parsing is essential,
      and create a fast, short solution that
      mixes procedural and declarative.
    </p>
    <h3>The application</h3>
    <p>This is a sample of the language:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
A2(A2(S3(Hey)S13(Hello, World!))S5(Ciao!))
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It describes strings in nested arrays.
      The strings are introduced by the letter 'S', followed by a length count and then,
      in parentheses, the string itself.
      Arrays are introduced by the letter 'A' followed by an element count and, inside parentheses, the
      array's contents.
      These contents are a concatenated series of strings and other arrays.
      I call this a Dyck-Hollerith language because it
      combines
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollerith_constant">
        Hollerith constants</a>
      (strings preceded by a count),
      with balanced parentheses
      (what is called
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyck_language">
        a Dyck language</a>
      by mathematicians).
    </p>
    <p>
      The language is one I've dealt with before.
      It is apparently from "real life", and is described more fully
      in
      <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/polettix/2012/04/parserecdescent-and-number-of-elements-read-on-the-fly.html">
        a blog post by
        Flavio Poletti</a>.
      Several people, Gabor Szabo among them, prodded me to show how
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Marpa-web-site/">
        Marpa</a>
      would do on this language.
      I did this
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2012/04/marpa-v-parserecdescent-some-numbers.html">a year ago, using Marpa's previous version, Marpa::XS</a>.
      The result was well-received and quite satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time around, I used
      Marpa's latest version, Marpa::R2,
      and its new interface, the SLIF.
      The solution presented here was
      much easer to write,
      and will be easier to read.
      It is also several times faster.
    </p>
    <h3>The code</h3>
    <p>The full code for this example is in
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/jeffreykegler/5745272">
        a Github gist</a>.
      In what follows, I will assume the reader is
      interested in the ideas.
      Details of the interface,
      along with more detail-oriented tutorials,
      can be found
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2">
        in Marpa's documentation</a>.
      Other tutorials are
      on
      <a href=http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/">
        the Ocean of Awareness blog</a>,
      and on
      <a href="http://marpa-guide.github.io/index.html">
        the Marpa Guide,
        a new website</a>
      being
      built due to the generosity of Peter Stuifzand
      and Ron Savage.
    </p>
    <h3>The DSL</h3>
    <p>First off, let's look at the declarative part.
      The core of the parser is the following lines,
      containing the BNF for the language's top-level structure.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
my $dsl = &lt;&lt;'END_OF_DSL';
# The BNF
:start ::= sentence
sentence ::= element
array ::= 'A' &lt;array count&gt; '(' elements ')'
    action =&gt; check_array
string ::= ( 'S' &lt;string length&gt; '(' ) text ( ')' )
elements ::= element+
  action =&gt; ::array
element ::= string | array
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Details of this syntax are in Marpa's documentation,
      but it's a dialect of EBNF.
      Adverbs like
      <tt>action =&gt; semantics</tt>
      tell Marpa what the semantics will be.
      The default (which will be set below) is for a rule to return its first child.
      <tt>::array</tt>
      semantics tell Marpa to return all every
      <tt>element</tt>
      of
      <tt>elements</tt>
      in an array.
      And
      <tt>check_array</tt>
      is the name of a function providing
      the semantics, as will be seen below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Single-quoted strings are looked for literally in the input.
      In the
      <tt>string</tt>
      declaration,
      you'll note some parentheses which are not in quotes.
      The unquoted parentheses are part of the Marpa DSL's own syntax,
      telling Marpa to "hide" the parenthesized symbols from the
      semantics.
      Here, the effect is that
      <tt>text</tt>
      is treated by the semantics as if it
      were the "first" symbol.
    </p>
    <p>Marpa's SLIF provides a lexer for the user,
      and this Marpa-internal lexer will handle most
      of the symbols in this example.
      The single-quoted strings we saw in the BNF are actually instructions
      to the internal lexer.
      The next lines tell Marpa how to recognize
      <tt>&lt;array count&gt;</tt>
      and
      <tt>&lt;string length&gt;</tt>.
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;array count&gt; ~ [\d]+
&lt;string length&gt; ~ [\d]+
text ~ [\d\D]
END_OF_DSL
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <tt>&lt;array_count&gt;</tt>
      and
      <tt>&lt;string length&gt;</tt>
      are both declared to be a series of digits.
      <tt>text</tt>
      is a stub.
      The length of
      <tt>text</tt>
      depends on the numeric value of
      <tt>&lt;string length&gt;</tt>, and dealing with that is beyond the power of
      the BNF.
      When it comes time to count out the symbols needed for
      <tt>text</tt>,
      we will hand control over to an external lexer.
      For the purposes of Marpa's lexer,
      <tt>text</tt>
      is described
      as a single character of any kind.
      Marpa's internal scanner uses a longest tokens match algorithm,
      and since we don't want the internal scanner to read
      <tt>text</tt>
      lexemes,
      describing
      <tt>text</tt>
      and other purely external lexemes
      as single characters is the right thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>Now comes the weld between declarative and procedural ...
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
:lexeme ~ &lt;string length&gt; pause =&gt; after
:lexeme ~ text pause =&gt; before
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These two statements tell Marpa that
      <tt>&lt;string length&gt;</tt>
      and
      <tt>&lt;text&gt;</tt>
      are two lexicals at which Marpa's own parsing should "pause",
      handing over control to external procedural parsing logic.
      In the case of
      <tt>&lt;string length&gt;</tt>,
      the pause should be after it is read.
      In the case of
      <tt>&lt;text&gt;</tt>
      the pause should be before.
      What happens during the "pause", we will soon see.
    </p>
    <h3>Starting the parse</h3>
    <p>Next follows the code to read the DSL,
      and start the parser.
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
my $grammar = Marpa::R2::Scanless::G-&gt;new(
    {   action_object  =&gt; 'My_Actions',
        default_action =&gt; '::first',
        source         =&gt; \$dsl
    }
);

my $recce = Marpa::R2::Scanless::R-&gt;new( { grammar =&gt; $grammar } );
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The previous lines tell Marpa that when its semantics
      are provided by a Perl closure, it is to look for that closure in a package called
      <tt>My_Actions</tt>.
      The default semantics are
      <tt>::first</tt>, which means simply pass the value of
      the first RHS symbol of a rule upwards.
    </p>
    <h3>The main loop</h3>
    <p>We saw our input above:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
$input = 'A2(A2(S3(Hey)S13(Hello, World!))S5(Ciao!))';
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The block of code which follows is the main loop through the parse, including
      all the procedural parsing logic.
      Below, I will pull this
      procedural parsing logic out of the loop
      for separate examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the
      <tt>$recce-&gt;read()</tt>
      method performs the first read
      and sets up the input string.
      The interior of the loop is entered whenever Marpa "pauses".
      Once the procedural parsing logic is done, Marpa resumes with
      the
      <tt>$recce-&gt;resume()</tt>
      call.
      Throughout,
      <tt>$pos</tt>
      is used to track the current character
      in the input stream.
      The loop ends when
      <tt>$pos</tt>
      is after the last character of
      <tt>$input</tt>.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
my $last_string_length;
my $input_length = length $input;
INPUT:
for (
    my $pos = $recce-&gt;read( \$input );
    $pos &lt; $input_length;
    $pos = $recce-&gt;resume($pos)
    )
{
    my $lexeme = $recce-&gt;pause_lexeme();
    die q{Parse exhausted in front of this string: "},
        substr( $input, $pos ), q{"}
        if not defined $lexeme;
    my ( $start, $lexeme_length ) = $recce-&gt;pause_span();
    if ( $lexeme eq 'string length' ) {
        $last_string_length = $recce-&gt;literal( $start, $lexeme_length ) + 0;
        $pos = $start + $lexeme_length;
        next INPUT;
    }
    if ( $lexeme eq 'text' ) {
        my $text_length = $last_string_length;
        $recce-&gt;lexeme_read( 'text', $start, $text_length );
        $pos = $start + $text_length;
        next INPUT;
    } ## end if ( $lexeme eq 'text' )
    die "Unexpected lexeme: $lexeme";
} ## end INPUT: for ( my $pos = $recce-&gt;read( \$input ); $pos &lt; $input_length...)
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>The procedural parsing</h3>
    <p>In this language,
      we need the procedural parsing logic to count the
      <tt>text</tt>
      strings properly.
      This is done in a very direct way.
      First we pull the count from
      <tt>&lt;string length&gt;</tt>:
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
    if ( $lexeme eq 'string length' ) {
        $last_string_length = $recce-&gt;literal( $start, $lexeme_length ) + 0;
        $pos = $start + $lexeme_length;
        next INPUT;
    }
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Above, we used
      <tt>pause_span()</tt>
      to set
      <tt>$start</tt>
      and
      <tt>$lexeme_length</tt>
      to the start and length of the lexeme that
      Marpa's internal scanner found.
      Passed to
      <tt>$recce-&gt;literal()</tt>, these two values
      return the "literal" string value of the lexeme, which will
      be the ASCII representation of a decimal number.
      We convert it to numeric, salt it away in
      <tt>$last_string_length</tt>,
      and set
      <tt>$pos</tt>
      to the location just after the
      <tt>&lt;string length&gt;</tt>
      lexeme.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
    if ( $lexeme eq 'text' ) {
        my $text_length = $last_string_length;
        $recce-&gt;lexeme_read( 'text', $start, $text_length );
        $pos = $start + $text_length;
        next INPUT;
    } ## end if ( $lexeme eq 'text' )
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Now we come to counting out the characters for the
      <tt>text</tt>
      lexeme.
      Recall that in the case of
      <tt>text</tt>, we pause
      <b>before</b>
      the lexeme, which means it will not have been read yet.
      With
      <tt>$recce-&gt;lexeme_read()</tt>, we tell Marpa
      that we want the next lexeme
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>to be of type
        <tt>text</tt>,
      </li>
      <li>to start at the already decided
        <tt>$start</tt>
        position, and
      </li>
      <li>
        to be of the length that
        we saved in
        <tt>$last_string_length</tt>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We also set
      <tt>$pos</tt>
      to be just after the
      end of the lexeme.
    </p>
    <p>We've focused on the string lengths, but the Dyck-Hollerith language has
      a count of the number of elements in its array.
      Marpa's BNF-driven parsing logic has no trouble
      determining the number of elements from the array contents,
      and it does not need the count.
      What to do with it?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
package My_Actions;
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
sub check_array {
    my ( undef, undef, $declared_size, undef, $array ) = @_;
    my $actual_size = @{$array};
    warn
        "Array size ($actual_size) does not match that specified ($declared_size)"
        if $declared_size != $actual_size;
    return $array;
} ## end sub check_array
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Recall that Marpa promised special semantics for the
      <tt>array</tt>
      rule
      in its DSL.
      Here they are.
      The first parameter to Marpa's semantic closures is a per-parse variable, here unused.
      The rest are the values of the RHS symbols, in order.
      We only care about the second (for
      <tt>&lt;array count&gt;</tt>),
      and the fourth (for
      <tt>elements</tt>).
      We determine a
      <tt>$declared_size</tt>
      from
      <tt>&lt;array count&gt;</tt>;
      and an
      <tt>$actual_size</tt>
      by looking at the array referenced by
      <tt>$array</tt>.
      If these differ, we choose to warn the user.
      Depending on your purposes,
      anything from ignoring the issue
      to throwing a fatal error may be equally or more reasonable.
    </p>
    <h3>The result of the the parse</h3>
    <p>And now we are ready to take the result of the parse.
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
my $result = $recce-&gt;value();
die 'No parse' if not defined $result;
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>For more about Marpa</h3>
    <p>The techniques described apply to problems considerably
      larger than the example of this post.
      Jean-Damien Durand is using them to create
      <a href="https://github.com/jddurand/MarpaX-Languages-C-AST">
        a C-to-AST tool</a>.
      This
      takes C language and converts it to an AST,
      following the C11
      specification carefully.
      The AST can then be manipulated
      as you wish.

</center>
  <p>
      <!--

      -->
      In the Perl world at this moment,
      a lot is being said about the consequences of bad design.
      And it is useful to study design failures.
      But the exercise will come to nothing
      without a road to good design.
      This post will point out four
      Perl-centric
      projects that
      are worth study as models
      of good design.
    </p>
    <p>
      The projects are
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/ack">
      ack</a>,
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/App-cpanminus">
      cpanm</a>,
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/local-lib">local::lib</a> and
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/App-perlbrew">perlbrew</a>.
      Each of these is perfect
      in the older sense of "having all that is requisite to its nature and kind"
      (<a href="http://1828.mshaffer.com/d/word/perfect">Webster's 1828</a>).
	If you are into Perl,
	they are all widely useful,
	and looking at them as a potential or an actual user
	is the best way to gain an appreciation of the art behind them.
    </p>
    <p><tt>ack</tt> is a file search tool -- UNIX's grep with improvements.
      The improvements are influenced by a Perl sensibility,
      and <tt>ack</tt> is written in Perl.
      But while the other tools I list are of little interest unless
      you are into Perl,
      <tt>ack</tt> can help you out even if you otherwise shun Perl tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      <tt>cpanm</tt> is for installing CPAN packages from CPAN.
      If you don't know what that means, you aren't interested.
      If you do, you want to be using it.
      It does everything you need and importantly, nothing more.
      The interface is without clutter.
      Like I said, perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <tt>local::lib</tt> is for installing Perl modules in the directory of your choice.
      Even if you have root permission on a system,
      it is good practice to leave the delivered Perl on your system
      untouched except by vendor-sponsored patches and updates.
      <tt>local::lib</tt> allows you to do this easily and conveniently.
      It has every feature and convenience I want.
      And reading its documentation is again an encounter with
      perfection.
      Every feature described is
      <ul>
      <li>something that you need today,
      <li>something that you are worried you might need tomorrow, or
      <li>something that you are not worried you might need,
      but on reading the documentation will discover that you should be.
      </ul>
      Aside from that, there is nothing else.
      Clutter-free.  Perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repeated perfection can be boring,
      a fact which
      I suspect plays no small role
      in making perfection an unusual thing in this world.
      So of <tt>perlbrew</tt>,
      I will simply say that it does for Perl versions and executables
      what <tt>local::lib</tt> does for Perl modules.
      <tt>perlbrew</tt> is the way to manage alternative Perl executables.
      And using <tt>perlbrew</tt>
      is a good way to study yet another perfect interface.
    </p>
    <p>
    How much relevance does the work of
      Andy Lester (<tt>ack</tt>),
      Tatsuhiko Miyagawa (<tt>cpanm</tt>),
      Matt S Trout (<tt>local::lib</tt>)
      and Kang-min Liu (<tt>perlbrew</tt>) have to other projects,
      including projects that now seem larger and more complex?
      Certainly
      these four applications all seem simple, well-defined,
      and self-contained.
      But I would argue that,
      if these problems seem simple and well-defined today,
      much of that impression is the result of the design skills
      of Andy, Tatsuhiko, Matt and Kang-min.
      And if, to an extent, they did benefit from
      having the good fortune to pick the the right problem at
      the right time,
      it is useful to recall
      Ben Hogan's comment on his profession:
    </p>
    <blockquote>Golf is a game of luck.
      The more I practice, the luckier I get.
    </blockquote>
