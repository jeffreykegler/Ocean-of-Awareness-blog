    <h2>Procedural parsing</h2>
    <p>Marpa is an Earley-based parser,
      and Earley parsers are typically not good at procedural parsing.
      Many programmers are used to recursive descent (RD),
      which has been state-of-the-art in terms of
      its procedural programming capabilities --
      it was these capabilities which led to
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2018/05/fast_power.html">
      RD's
      triumph over the now-forgotten Irons algorithm.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Marpa, however, has a parse engine expressly redesigned<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>
      to handle procedural logic well.
      In fact, Marpa is <b>better</b> at procedural logic
      than RD.
    </p>
    <h2>A context-sensitive grammar</h2>
    <p>Marpa parses all LR-regular grammars in linear time,
    so the first challenge is to find a grammar
    that illustrates a
    <b>need</b> for procedural logic, even when Marpa is used.
    The following is the canonical example of a grammar that is
    context-sensitive, but not context-free:
    </p>
    <pre>
          a^n . b^n . c^n : n >= 1
    </pre>
    I will call this the "ABC grammar".
    It is a sequence of
    <tt>a</tt>'s,
    <tt>b</tt>'s, and
    <tt>c</tt>'s,
    in alphabetical order,
    where the character counts are all
    equal to each other and greater
    than one.
    </p>
    <p>The ABC "grammar" is really a counting problem more than
    a natural parsing problem,
    and parsing is not the fastest or easiest way to solve it.
    Three tight loops, with counters, would do the same job nicely,
    and would be much faster.
    But I chose the ABC grammar for exactly this reason.
    It <b>is</b> simple in itself,
    but it is tricky when treated as a parsing problem.<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    In picking the strategy below,
    I opted for one that illustrates
    a nice subset of Marpa's procedural parsing capabilities.
    Full code is
    <a href="https://github.com/jeffreykegler/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/tree/gh-pages/code/csg">
    on-line<a>,
    and readers are encouraged to "peek ahead".
    </p>
    <h2>Step 1: the syntax</h2>
    <p>Our strategy will be to start with a context-free syntax,
    and then extend it with procedural logic.
    Here is the context-free grammar:
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
    lexeme default = latm => 1
    :default ::= action => [name,start,length,values]
    S ::= prefix ABC trailer
    ABC ::= ABs Cs
    ABs ::= A ABs B | A B
    prefix ::= A*
    trailer ::= C_extra*
    A ~ 'a'
    B ~ 'b'
    :lexeme ~ Cs pause => before event => 'before C'
    Cs ~ 'c' # dummy -- procedural logic reads <Cs>
    C_extra ~ 'c'
    </tt></pre>
    <p>The first line is boiler-plate:
    It turns off a default which was made pointless
    by a later enhancement to Marpa::R2.
    Marpa::R2 is stable, and backward-compatibility is
    a very high priority.
    <pre><tt>
    :default ::= action => [name,start,length,values]
    </tt></pre>
    <p>
    We will produce a parse tree.
    The second line defines its format --
    each node is an array whose elements are,
    in order,
    the node name, its start position,
    its length and its child nodes.
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
    S ::= prefix ABC trailer
    </tt></pre>
    <p>The symbol <tt>&lt;ABC&gt;</tt>
    is our "target" -- the counted
    <tt>a</tt>'s,
    <tt>b</tt>'s,
    and <tt>c</tt>'s.
    To make things a bit more interesting,
    and to make the problem more like a parsing problem instead of a counting problem,
    we allow a prefix of <tt>a</tt>'s
    and a trailer of <tt>c</tt>'s.
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
    ABC ::= ABs Cs
    </tt></pre>
    <p>We divide the
    <tt>&lt;ABC&gt;</tt> target into two parts:
    <tt>&lt;ABs&gt;</tt>, which contains the
    <tt>a</tt>'s,
    and <tt>b</tt>'s;
    and
    <tt>&lt;Cs&gt;</tt>, which contains
    the <tt>c</tt>'s.
    </p>
    <p>
    The string
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
    a^n . b^n
    </tt></pre>
    <p>
    is context free, so that we can handle it
    without procedural logic, as follows:
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
    ABs ::= A ABs B | A B
    </tt></pre>
    <p>
    The line above recognizes a non-empty string of
    <tt>a</tt>'s,
    followed by an equal number
    of <tt>b</tt>'s.
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
    prefix ::= A*
    trailer ::= C_extra*
    </tt></pre>
    <p>As stated above,
    <tt>&lt;prefix&gt;</tt>
    is a series of <tt>a</tt>'s and
    <tt>&lt;trailer&gt;</tt>
    is a series of <tt>c</tt>'s.
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
    A ~ 'a'
    B ~ 'b'
    </tt></pre>
    <p>Marpa::R2 has a separate lexical and syntactic phase.
    Here we define our lexemes.
    The first two are simple enough:
    <tt>&lt;A&gt;</tt> is the character "<tt>a</tt>"; and
    <tt>&lt;B&gt;</tt> is the character "<tt>b</tt>".
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
    :lexeme ~ Cs pause => before event => 'before C'
    Cs ~ 'c' # dummy -- procedural logic reads <Cs>
    C_extra ~ 'c'
    </tt></pre>
    <p>
    For the character "<tt>c</tt>",
    we need procedural logic.
    As hooks for procedural logic,
    Marpa allows a full range of events.
    Events can occur on prediction and completion of symbols;
    when symbols are nulled;
    before lexemes;
    and after lexemes.
    The first line in the above display
    declares a "before lexeme" event
    on the symbol
    <tt>&lt;Cs&gt;</tt>.
    The name of the event is "<tt>before C</tt>".
    </p>
    <p>The second line is a dummy entry,
    which is needed to allow the "<tt>before C</tt>"
    event to trigger.
    The entry says that
    <tt>&lt;Cs&gt;</tt> is a single character "<tt>c</tt>".
    This is false --
    <tt>&lt;Cs&gt;</tt> is a series of one or more
    <tt>c</tt>'s,
    which needs to be counted.
    But when
    the "<tt>before C</tt>" event triggers,
    the procedural
    logic will make things right.
    </p>
    <p>The third line defines
    <tt>&lt;C_extra&gt;</tt>, which
    is another lexeme for the character "<tt>c</tt>".
    We have two different lexemes for
    the character <tt>c</tt>, because we want some
    <tt>c</tt>'s (those in the target)
    to trigger events;
    and we want other
    <tt>c</tt>'s (those in the trailer)
    not to trigger events,
    but to be consumed by Marpa directly.
    </p>
    <h2>The procedural logic</h2>
    <p>
    At this point, we have solved part of the problem with context-free syntax,
    and set up a Marpa event named "<tt>before C</tt>",
    which will solve the rest of it.
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
    my $input_length = length ${$input};
    for (
        my $pos = $recce->read($input);
        $pos < $input_length;
        $pos = $recce->resume()
      )
    {
      </tt><b>... Process events ...</b><tt>
    }
    </tt></pre>
    <p>Processing of events takes place inside a Marpa read loop.
    This is initialized with a <tt>read()</tt> method,
    and is continued with a <tt>resume()</tt> method.
    The <tt>read()</tt> and <tt>resume()</tt> methods
    both return the current position
    in the input.
    If the current position is end-of-input, we are done.
    If not, we were interrupted by an event, which we
    must process.
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
    </tt><b>Process events</b><tt>

    EVENT:
      for (
	  my $event_ix = 0 ;
	  my $event    = $recce->event($event_ix) ;
	  $event_ix++
	)
      {
	  my $name = $event->[0];
	  if ( $name eq 'before C' ) {
	      </tt><b>... Process "before C" event ...</b><tt>
	  }
	  die qq{Unexpected event: name="$name"};
      }
    </tt></pre>
    <p>In this application, only one event can occur at any location,
    so the above loop is "overkill".
    It loops through the events, one by one.
    The <tt>event</tt> method returns a reference to an array
    of event data.
    The only element we care about is the event name.
    In fact, if we weren't being careful about error checking,
    we would not even care about the event name,
    since there can be only one.
    </p>
    <p>If, as expected, the event name is "<tt>before C</tt>",
    we process it.
    In any other case, we die with an error message.
    </p>
    <pre><tt>
    </tt><b>Process "before C" event</b><tt>

    my ( $start, $length ) = $recce->last_completed_span('ABs');
    my $c_length = ($length) / 2;
    my $c_seq = ( 'c' x $c_length );
    if ( substr( ${$input}, $pos, $c_length ) eq $c_seq ) {
	$recce->lexeme_read( 'Cs', $pos, $c_length, $c_seq );
	next EVENT;
    }
    die qq{Too few C's};
    </tt></pre>
    <p>This is the core part of our procedural logic,
    where we have a "<tt>before C</tt>" event.
    We must
    <ul>
    <li>determine the right number of <tt>c</tt> characters;</li>
    <li>check that the input has
      the right number of <tt>c</tt> characters;</li>
    <li>put together a lexeme to feed the Marpa parser; and</li>
    <li>return control to Marpa.</li>
    </ul>
    There is a lot going on,
    and some of Marpa's most powerful capabilities for assisting
    procedural logic are shown here.
    So we will go through the above display in detail.
    </p>
    <h3>Left-eidetic</h3>
    <pre><tt>
    my ( $start, $length ) = $recce->last_completed_span('ABs');
    my $c_length = ($length) / 2;
    </tt></pre>
    <p>Marpa claims to be "left-eidetic",
    that is, to have full knowledge of the parse so far,
    and to make this knowledge available to the programmer.
    How does a programmer cash in on this promise?
    <p>Of course, there is
    <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Marpa-R2/pod/Progress.pod">a fully general interface</a>,
    which allows you to go through the Earley tables and extract
    the information in any form necessary.
    But another, more convenient interface,
    fits our purposes here.
    Specifically,
    </p>
    <ul><li>we want to determine how many <tt>c</tt> characters we are looking for.</li>
    <li>How many <tt>c</tt> characters we are looking for depends
    on the number of
    <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> characters that we have already seen
    in the target.</li>
    <li>The <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> characters that we have already seen in the
    target are in the
    <tt>&lt;ABs&gt;</tt> symbol instance.</li>
    <li>So, what we want to know is the length of the
    most recent <tt>&lt;ABs&gt;</tt> symbol instance.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Marpa has a <tt>last_completed_span()</tt> method,
    and that is just what we need.
    This finds the most recent instance of a symbol.
    (If there had been more than one most recent instance,
    it would have found the longest.)
    The <tt>last_completed_span()</tt> method returns the start
    of the symbol instance (which we do not care about)
    and its length.
    The desired number of <tt>c</tt> characters,
    <tt>$c_length</tt>, is half the length of the
    <tt>&lt;ABs&gt;</tt> instance.
    </p>
    <h3>External parsing</h3>
    <pre><tt>
    my $c_seq = ( 'c' x $c_length );
    if ( substr( ${$input}, $pos, $c_length ) eq $c_seq ) { </tt><b>...</b><tt> }
    </tt></pre>
    <p>Marpa allows external parsing.
    You can pause Marpa, as we have done,
    and hand control over to another parser -- including
    another instance of Marpa.
    </p>
    <p>
    Here external parsing is necessary to make our parser
    context-sensitive,
    but the external parser does not have to be fancy.
    All it needs to do is
    some counting -- not hard,
    but something that a context-free grammar cannot do.
    </p>
    <p>
    Here <tt>$pos</tt> is the current position in the input,
    as returned by the <tt>read()</tt> or <tt>resume()</tt>
    method in the outer loop.
    Our input is the string referred to by <tt>$input</tt>.
    We just calculated <tt>$c_length</tt> as the number of
    <tt>c</tt> characters required.
    The above code checks to see that the required number of
    <tt>c</tt> characters is at <tt>$pos</tt> in the input.
    </p>
    <h3>Communicating with Marpa</h3>
    <pre><tt>
	$recce->lexeme_read( 'Cs', $pos, $c_length, $c_seq );
    </tt></pre>
    <p>
    Our external logic is doing the parsing,
    but we need to let Marpa know what we are finding.
    We do this with the <tt>lexeme_read()</tt> method.
    <tt>lexeme_read()</tt> needs to know what symbol we are reading
    (<tt>Cs</tt> in our case);
    and its value
    (<tt>$c_seq</tt> in our case).
    </p>
    <p>
    Marpa requires that
    every symbol be tied in some way to the input.
    The tie-in is only for error reporting,
    and it can be hack-ish or completely artificial,
    if necessary.
    In this application, our symbol instance is tied into
    the input in a very natural way --
    it is the stretch of the input that we compared
    to <tt>$c_seq</tt> in the display before last.
    We therefore tell Marpa
    that the symbol is at <tt>$pos</tt> in the input,
    and of length <tt>$c_length</tt>.
    </p>
    <h3>Passing control back to Marpa</h3>
    <pre><tt>
	next EVENT;
    </tt></pre>
    <p>
    External parsing can go on quite a long time.
    In fact, an external parser <b>never</b> has to hand
    control back to Marpa.
    But in this case, we are done very quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
    We ask for the next iteration of the <tt>EVENT</tt>
    loop.
    (In this code,
    there will not be a next iteration, unless there is an error.)
    Once done, the <tt>EVENT</tt> loop will hand control
    over to the outer loop.
    The outer loop will call the <tt>resume()</tt>
    method to return control back to Marpa.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p id="footnote-1"><b>1.</b>
      To handle procedural logic well,
      an Earley engine needs to complete its Earley sets
      in strict order --
      that is, Earley set <tt>N</tt>
      cannot change after work on Earley set <tt>N+1</tt>
      has begun.
      I have not looked at every Earley parse engine,
      and some may have had this strict-sequencing property.
      And many of the papers are agnostic about the order
      of operations.
      But Marpa is the first Earley parser to recognize
      and exploit strict-sequencing as a feature.

    The ABC grammar, in fact,
    is not all that easy or natural to describe

    <h2>Derivatives == Earley?</h2>
    <p>In a cordial Twitter exchange with Matt Might and
      and David Darais, Prof. Might asked if I was interested
      in looking at their derivatives-based approach.
      I answered that I was looking at it --
      Marpa is an optimization of the Might/Darais approach.
    </p>
    <p>This may sound strange.
      At first glance, our two algorithms seem about as different as
      parsing algorithms can get.
      My Marpa parser is an Earley parser, table-driven,
      and its parse engine is written in C language.<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The MDS (Might/Darais/Spiewak) parser is
      an extension of regular expressions
      which constructs states on the fly.
      MDS uses combinators and has implementations
      in several functional programming languages.<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Grammar Flow Graphs</h2>
    <p>Why then do I imagine that Marpa is an optimized version of the MDS
      approach?
      The reason is a paper sent to
      me by Prof. Keshav Pingali at Austin: "Parsing with Pictures".<a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>
      The title is a little misleading:
      their approach is not
      <b>that</b>
      easy,
      and the paper requires a considerable amount of math.
      But it is a lot easier than the traditional way
      of learning the various approaches to parsing.
    </p>
    <p>The basis of the Pingali-Bilardi approach
      is the Grammar Flow Graph (GFG).
      These GFGs are the "pictures" of their title.
      GFGs are NFAs with recursion added.
      As has long been known,
      adding recursion to NFAs
      allows them to represent any context-free language.
    </p>
    <p>Pingali and Bilardi's next step is new.
      A GFG can be "simulated" using the same algorithm
      used to simulate an NFA.
      However, the result is not immediately impressive.
      The simulation does produce a recognizer, but not a good recognizer:
      Some of the strings recognized by
      the GFG simulator
      are not in the context-free language.<a id="footnote-4-ref" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>
    </p>
    <p>To repair their "simulation",
      Pingali and Bilardi add a tag to each state.
      This tag tracks where the recursion began.<a id="footnote-5-ref" href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>.
      This not only fixes the recognizer,
      but the added information is enough to allow the set
      of parse trees to be efficiently recovered from the
      sets of GFG states.
      In other words, with tags, the GFG recognizer now is a parser.
    </p>
    <p>
      It turns out that this recognizer-turned-parser is not new.
      In fact, it is
      <b>exactly</b>
      Earley's algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>Pingali and Bilardi do not stop there.
      Using their new framework,
      they go on to show that all LL-based and LR-based algorithms
      are simplifications of their Earley parser.
      From this point of view,
      Earley parsing is the foundation of all context-free parsing,
      and LL- and LR-based algorithms are Earley optimizations.<a id="footnote-6-ref" href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>
    </p><h2>Step 1: The MDS algorithm</h2>
    <p>
      To show that Marpa is an optimization of the MDS approach,
      I will start with the MDS algorithm, and attempt to optimize it.
      For its functional programming language,
      the MDS paper uses Racket.
      The MDS parser is described directly,
      in the usual functional language manner,
      as a matching
      operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the MDS paper,
      the MDS parser is optimized with laziness and memoization.
      Nulls are dealt with by computing their fixed points on the fly.
      Even with these three optimizations,
      the result is still highly inefficient.
      So,
      as an additional step, MDS also
      implements "deep recursive simplication" -- in effect,
      strategically replacing laziness with eagerness.
      With this the MDS paper conjectures that the algorithm's time
      is linear for a large class of practical grammars.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2: Extended regular expressions</h2>
    <p>
      Next, we notice that the context-free grammars
      of the MDS algorithm
      are regular expressions extended to allow recursion.
      Essentially, they are
      GFG's translated into Racket match expressions.
      The equivalence is close enough that
      you could imagine the MDS paper using GFG's
      for its illustrations.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3: Simulating an NFA</h2>
    <p>
      Unsurprisingly, then,
      the MDS and GFG approaches are similar in their first step.
      Each consumes a single character to produce a
      "partial parse".
      A partial parse, for both of these algorithms,
      can be represented as a duple.
      One element of the duple is a string representing the
      unconsumed input.
      The other is a representation of a set of parse trees.
      In the case of MDS,
      in keeping with its functional approach,
      the set of parse trees is represented directly.
      In the case of the GFG-simulator,
      the set of parse trees is compressed into a sequence of
      GFG-state-sets.
      There is one GFG-state-set for the start of parsing,
      and one for each consumed character.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 4: Earley's Algorithm</h2>
    <p>At this point,
      with the introduction of the GFG state-sets to represent parse-trees,
      the MDS algorithm and its optimized GFG equivalent have
      "forked".
      Recall from above,
      that this GFG simulator has a bug --
      it is over-liberal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bug is the one already described,
      and our fix is the one already described:
      Each GFG state either starts a recursion or is part of one.
      We fix the bug by tagging each GFG state with
      the index of the GFG state-set that starts its recursion.
      Once these tags are added,
      the GFG state-sets are exactly Earley sets.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 5: The Leo optimization</h2>
    <p>Next we incorporate an optimization by Joop Leo,
      which makes Earley parsing linear for all LR-regular grammars,
      without using lookahead.
      Since LR-regular is a superset of LR(k) and LL(k),
      including LL(*),
      we do not bother with lookahead.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 6: Marpa</h2>
    <p>To get from an Earley/Leo parser to a Marpa parser,
      we need to address one more major point.
      In modern parsing practice,
      programmers expect the ability to introduce procedural logic,
      even to the point of switching parsers.
      By ensuring that processing each Earley set is complete
      before processing on the next Earley set begins,
      we accomplish this.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that Marpa has available full information
      about the parse so far -- it is left-eidetic.
      Error reporting is unexcelled,
      and procedural logic can use this information as well.
      For example,
      full parse information implies full knowledge of which
      tokens are expected next.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that you can write an liberal HTML parser,
      starting with a very illiberal HTML grammar.
      When the illiberal parser encounters a point where it cannot
      continue because of a missing token,
      procedural logic can ask
      what the expected token is;
      concoct that token on the fly;
      supply that token to the illiberal parser;
      and then ask the illiberal parser to continue.
      This is called the "Ruby Slippers" technique,
      and an HTML parser based on it has been implemented.<a id="footnote-7-ref" href="#footnote-7">[7]</a>
    </p>
    <h2>The way forward</h2>
    <p>
      As mentioned,
      the MDS algorithm has its own approach to optmization,
      one which takes maximum advantage of functional programming.
      In contrast, Marpa relies on C level coding.
    </p>
    <p>One example of the contrast in optimization techniques
      is null handling.
      Recall from above that, to deal with null processing,
      the MDS algorithm uses a fixed-point
      algorithm on the fly.
      Marpa, on the other hand,
      before parsing begins.
      precomputes a list of nullable
      symbols using bit vectors.
      In this particular case, Marpa will usually be the winner.
    </p>
    <p>A second case in which hand optimization wins is the
      all-important Leo optimization.
      Simon Peyton-Jones is a very smart man,
      but nonetheless I believe that
      the day that GHC will look at a functional specification
      of an Earley parser and rediscover the Leo optimization
      at compile time is far off.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand,
      I do not imagine that hand optimization and/or C language is the
      winner in all cases.
      A programmer is deceiving himself if he imagines that he can spot all the cases where
      lazy evaluation or memoization will be effective in the general case.
      And of course,
      even an omniscient programmer is not going to be there at run-time
      to do "just in time" optimization.
      Perhaps the optimal parser of the future will combine important hand optimizations
      with functional programming.

      -->
    <p>It is often said that parsing is a "solved problem".
      Given the level of frustration with the state of the art,
      the underuse of the very powerful technique of
      Language-Oriented Programming due to problematic tools<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>,
      and the vast superiority of human parsing ability
      over computers,
      this requires explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On what grounds would someone say that parsing is "solved"?
      To understand this,
      we need to look at the history of Parsing Theory.<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
      In fact, we'll have to start decades before computer Parsing Theory
      exists,
      with a now nearly-extinct school of linguistics,
      and its desire to put the field on strictly
      scientific basis.
    </p>
    <h2>1929: Bloomfield redefines "language"</h2>
    <p>In 1929 Leonard Bloomfield,
      as part of his effort to create a linguistics that
      would be taken seriously as a science,
      published his "Postulates".<a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>
      The "Postulates" include his definition of language:
    </p><blockquote>
      The totality of utterances that can be made in a speech
      community is the
      <b>language</b>
      of that speech-community.<a id="footnote-4-ref" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>
    </blockquote><p>
      There is no reference in this definition to the usual view,
      that the utterances of a language "mean" something.
      This omission is not accidental:
    </p><blockquote>
      The statement of meanings is therefore the weak point in
      language-study, and will remain so until human knowledge
      advances very far beyond its present state. In practice, we define the
      meaning of a linguistic form, wherever we can, in terms of some
      other science.<a id="footnote-5-ref" href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>
    </blockquote><p>
      Bloomfield is passing the buck,
      because the behaviorist science of his time rejects
      any claims about mental states as
      unverifiable statements -- essentially,
      as claims to be able to read minds.
      "Hard" sciences like physics, chemistry and even
      biology avoid dealing with unverifiable mental states.
      Bloomfield and the behaviorists want to make the methods of linguistics
      as close to hard science as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Draconian as Bloomfield's exclusion of meaning is,
      it is a big success.
      Known as structural linguistics,
      Bloomfield's approach dominates lingustics for
      the next couple of decades.
    </p>
    <h2>1955: Noam Chomsky graduates</h2>
    <p>
      Noam Chomsky earns his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania.
      His teacher, Zelig Harris, is a prominent Bloomfieldian,
      and Chomsky's early work is thought to be in the Bloomfield school.<a id="footnote-6-ref" href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>
      Chomsky becomes a professor at MIT.
      MIT does not have a linguistics department,
      and Chomsky is free to teach his own approach to the subject.
    </p>
    <h2>The term "language" as of 1956</h2>
    <p>Chomsky publishes his "Three models" paper,
      one of the most important papers of all time.
      His definition of language uses the terminology
      of set theory:
    </p><blockquote>
      By a language then, we shall mean a set (finite or infinite) of
      sentences, each of finite length, all constructed from a finite
      alphabet of symbols.<a id="footnote-7-ref" href="#footnote-7">[7]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This definition is pure Bloomfield in substance,
      but signs of departure from the behaviorist orthodoxy are
      apparent in "Three Models" --
      Chomsky is quite willing to talk about what sentences mean,
      when it serves his purposes.
      For a utterance with multiple meanings,
      Chomsky's new model produces multiple syntactic derivations.
      Each of these syntactic derivations
      "looks" like the natural representation
      of one of the meanings.
      Chomsky points out that the insight into semantics
      that his new model provides is a very
      desirable property to have.<a id="footnote-8-ref" href="#footnote-8">[8]</a>
    </p>
    <h2>1959: Chomsky reviews Skinner</h2>
    <p>In 1959, Chomsky reviews a book by B.F. Skinner's on linguistics.<a id="footnote-9-ref" href="#footnote-9">[9]</a>
      Skinner is the most prominent behaviorist of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chomsky's review removes all doubt about where he stands
      on behaviorism
      or on the relevance of linguistics to the study of meaning.<a id="footnote-10-ref" href="#footnote-10">[10]</a>
      His review galvanizes the opposition to behaviorism, and
      Chomsky establishes himself as behavorism's most
      prominent and effective critic.
    </p>
    <p>
      In later years,
      Chomsky will make it clear that he had had no intention
      of avoiding semantics:
    </p><blockquote>
      [...] it would be absurd to develop
      a general syntactic theory
      without assigning an absolutely
      crucial role to semantic considerations,
      since obviously the necessity to support
      semantic interpretation is one of the primary
      requirements
      that the structures
      generated by the syntactic component of a grammar
      must meet.<a id="footnote-11-ref" href="#footnote-11">[11]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>1961: Oettinger discovers pushdown automata</h2>
    <p>
      While the stack itself goes back to Turing<a id="footnote-12-ref" href="#footnote-12">[12]</a>,
      its significance for parsing becomes an object
      of interest in itself with
      Samuelson and Bauer's 1959 paper<a id="footnote-13-ref" href="#footnote-13">[13]</a>.
      Mathematical study of stacks as models of computing begins with Anthony Oettinger's 1961 paper.<a id="footnote-14-ref" href="#footnote-14">[14]</a></p>
    <p>Oettinger 1961 is full of evidence that stacks
      (which he calls "pushdown stores") are still very new.
      For example,
      Oettinger does not use the terms "push" or "pop",
      but instead describes operations on his pushdown stores using
      a set of vector operations which will later form the basis
      of the APL language.
    </p>
    <p>Oettinger defines 4 languages.
      Oettinger's definitions all follow the behavorist model --
      they are sets of strings.<a id="footnote-15-ref" href="#footnote-15">[15]</a>
      Oettinger's pushdown stores
      will eventually be called
      deterministic pushdown automata (DPDA's) and
      become the basis of a model of language
      and the subject of a substantial literature,
      all of which will use the behaviorist definition
      of "language".
    </p>
    <p>
      Oettinger hopes that DPDA's
      will be an adequate basis for
      the study of both computer and
      natural language translation.
      (Oettinger's own field is Russian translation.)
      DPDA's soon prove totally inadequate
      for natural languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for dealing with computing languages,
      DPDA's will have a much longer life.
      As of 1961, all algorithms with acceptable speed are using
      stacks with various modifications.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The development of a theory of pushdown algorithms should
      hopefully lead to systematic techniques for generating
      algorithms satisfying given requirements to replace
      the ad hoc invention of each new algorithm.<a id="footnote-16-ref" href="#footnote-16">[16]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The search for a comprehensive theory of
      stack-based parsing
      quickly becomes identified
      with the search for a theoretical basis for practical parsing.
    </p>
    <h2>1965: Knuth discovers LR(k)</h2>
    <p>Donald Knuth
      reports his new results on stack-based parsing.
      In a pivotal paper<a id="footnote-17-ref" href="#footnote-17">[17]</a>,
      Knuth sets out a theory that
      encompasses all the "tricks"<a id="footnote-18-ref" href="#footnote-18">[18]</a>
      used for efficient parsing up to that time.
      With this Oettinger's hope for a theory
      to replace "ad hoc invention" is fulfilled.
      In an exhilarating (and exhausting) 39-page
      demonstration of mathematical virtuousity,
      Knuth shows that stack-based parsing is
      equivalent to a new and unexpected class of grammars.
      Knuth calls these LR(k), and provides a parsing algorithm for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knuth's new algorithm might be expected to be "the one to rule
      them all".
      Unfortunately, while deterministic and linear,
      it is not practical -- it requires huge tables well beyond
      the memory capabilities of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impracticality of his LR(k) algorithm
      does not suggest to Knuth that the stack-based model
      is inappropriate as a model of practical parsing.
      Instead it suggests to him, and to the field,
      that the boundary of practical parsing lies in a subclass of the
      LR(k) grammars.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure,
      Knuth, in his program for further research<a id="footnote-19-ref" href="#footnote-19">[19]</a>,
      does suggests investigation of parsers for superclasses
      of LR(k).
      He even describes a new superclass of his own:
      LR(k,t), which is LR(k) with more aggressive lookahead.
      But he is clearly unenthusiastic about LR(k,t).<a id="footnote-20-ref" href="#footnote-20">[20]</a>
      It is reasonable to suppose
      that Knuth is even more negative about
      the more general approaches that
      he does not bother to mention.<a id="footnote-21-ref" href="#footnote-21">[21]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, those reading Knuth's LR(k) paper focused almost
      exclusively on his suggestions for research within the stack-based
      model.
      These included grammar rewrites;
      streamlining of the LR(k) tables;
      and research into LR(k) subclasses.
      It is LR(k) subclassing that will receive the most attention.<a id="footnote-22-ref" href="#footnote-22">[22]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea that the solution to the parsing problem must be
      stack-based is not without foundation.
      In 1965, the limits of computer technology are severe.
      For practitioners,
      any parsing technique that required much more
      than a reasonably-sized state
      machine and a stack,
      is not likely to happen.
      After all,
      only four years earlier,
      stacks were bleeding edge.
    </p>
    <p>The practitioners of 1965
      are inclined to believe that,
      like it or not,
      they are stuck with stack-based parsing.
      But why do the theoreticians feel compelled to follow them?
      The answer is that theoreticians talk themselves into
      it, using a misleading equivalence based
      on the behaviorist definition of language.
    </p>
    <h2>"Language" as of 1965</h2>
    <p>
      Knuth defines language as follows:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The language defined by G is<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      { &alpha; | S => &alpha; and &alpha; is a string over T }<br>
      namely, the set of all terminal strings derivable from S by using
      the productions of G as substitution rules.<a id="footnote-23-ref" href="#footnote-23">[23]</a>
    </blockquote><p>
      Here G is a grammar whose start symbol is S and whose set
      of terminals is T.
      This is the behavorist definition of language
      translated into set-theoretic terms.
    </p>
    <p>Knuth proves, to the satisfaction of the profession,
      the "equivalence" of LR(k) and DPDA's.
      LR(k) is a class of grammars and the DPDA model is of
      languages -- sets of strings.
      At first glance, this is an "apples and oranges" comparison --
      how do you prove the equivalence of a class of languages
      and a class of grammars?
    </p>
    <p>
      Knuth does this by reducing the class of DPDA languages and the class
      of grammars to their lowest common denominator, which is the language.
      And, of course, the "language" in the usage of Parsing Theory
      is a set of strings, without consideration of their syntax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every grammar, when stripped of its syntax, defines a language.
      So Knuth compares the language which results from stripping down
      the LR(k) grammars,
      to the language of DPDA's.
      After some very impressive mathematics,
      Knuth is able to show that the two languages are equivalent.
    </p>
    <p>
      In theoretical mathematics, of course,
      you can define "equivalent" however you like.
      But if the purpose is to suggest limits in practice,
      you have to be much more careful.
      And in fact, as Knuth's paper shows,
      if you equate languages and grammars,
      you get into a very serious degree of magical thinking.
      Using the Knuth algorithm,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>parsing LR(k) grammars for arbitrary k is hopelessly impractical;
      </li>
      <li>parsing LR(1) grammars is impractical, but close to the boundary<a id="footnote-24-ref" href="#footnote-24">[24]</a>;
        and
      </li>
      <li>parsing LR(0) grammars is very practical.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A problem for the relevance
      of Knuth's proof of equivalence is that,
      if you just look at sets of strings
      without regard to syntax,
      LR(1) and LR(k) are equivalent.
      That means that from the sets-of-strings point of view,
      hopelessly impractical and
      borderline impractical are the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worse, both LR(1) and LR(k) are equivalent to LR(0)
      for most applications.
      If you add
      an explicit end marker to an LR(1) language,
      which in most applications is easy to do<a id="footnote-25-ref" href="#footnote-25">[25]</a>,
      your LR(1) language becomes LR(0).
      Therefore, for most applications,
    </p>
    <center>
      LR(k) = LR(1) = LR(0)
    </center>
    <p>
      This means that, in the world of sets-of-strings,
      extremely impractical and very practical are usually the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly the world of sets of strings
      is a magical one,
      in which we can easily transport ourselves across the
      boundary between practical and impractical.
      We can take visions of a magical world back into the world of practice,
      but we cannot assume they will be helpful.
      In that light,
      it is no surprise that
      Joop Leo will show how to extend practical
      parsing well beyond LR(k).<a id="footnote-26-ref" href="#footnote-26">[26]</a>

          Given the capacity of computer memories in 1965,
          LR(1) was clearly impractical.
          With the huge computer memories of 2018,
          that could be reconsidered, but LR(1) is still restrictive
          and has poor error-handling,

    <h2>Chomsky's "Three Models" paper</h2>
    <p>
      <!--
      marpa_r2_html_fmt --no-added-tag-comment --no-ws-ok-after-start-tag
      -->
      Important papers produce important mistakes.
      A paper can contain a great many errors,
      and they will have no effect if the paper is ignored.
      On the other hand,
      even the good methods of
      a great paper can go badly wrong
      when its methods
      outlive the reasons for using them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chomsky's "Three Models" paper<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>
      is about as influential
      as a paper can get.
      Just 12 pages,
      it's the paper in which the most-cited scholar of our
      time first outlined his ideas.
      Even at the time,
      linguists described its effect on their field as
      "Copernician".<a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>
      Bringing new rigor into what had been seen as a "soft"
      science, it turned lots of heads outside linguistics.
      It belongs on anyone's list of the most important scientific papers ever.<a id="footnote-4-ref" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Given its significance,
      it is almost incidental that
      "Three models" is also the foundation paper of computer Parsing Theory,
      the subject of these blog posts.
      Chomsky does not consider himself a computer scientist
      and, after founding our field,
      has paid little attention to it.
      But in fact,
      the Chomskyan model has been even more dominant
      in computer parsing than in Chomsky's own
      field of linguistics.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three Models" places Chomksy among the great mathematicians
      of all time.
      True, the elegance and rigor of Chomsky's proofs
      better befit a slumming linguist
      than they would a professional mathematician.
      But at its heart,
      mathematics is not a technical field,
      or even about problem-solving --
      at its most fundamental,
      it is about framing problems so that they
      <b>can</b> be solved.
      And Chomsky's skill at framing problems is astonishing.
    </p>
    <h2>A brilliant simplification</h2>
    <p>
      In 1956,
      Chomsky had a new approach to linguistics,
      and wanted to prove that his approach to language
      did things that
      the previous approach,
      based on finite-state models,
      could not.
      ("Finite-state" models, also known as Markov chains,
      are the predecessors of the regular expressions
      of today.)
      Brilliantly,
      Chomsky sets out to do this with extremely minimal definition of what
      a language is.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      By a language then, we shall mean a set (finite or infinite) of
      sentences, each of finite length, all constructed from a finite
      alphabet of sysbols.  If A is an alphabet, we shall say that
      anything formed by concatenating the symbols of A is a string in
      A. By a grammar of the language L we mean a device of some sort that
      produces all of the strings that are sentences of L and only these.<a id="footnote-5-ref" href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Yes, you read that right --
    Chomsky uses a definition of language which has nothing to
    do with language actually meaning anything.
    A language, for the purposes of the math in "Three Models",
    is nothing but a list of strings.
    Similarly, a grammar is just something that enumerates
    those strings.
    The grammar does not have to provide any clue as to what
    the strings might mean.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, Chomsky would require of a French grammar that one of the
	strings that it lists be
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      (42) Ceci n'est pas une phrase vraie.
    </blockquote>
    <p>But for the purposes of his demonstration,
    Chomsky does not require of his "grammar" that it
    give us any guidance as to what sentence (42) might mean.
    <p>
    Chomsky shows that there are English sentences that his "grammar" would
    list,
    and which a finite-state "grammar" would not list.
    Clearly if the finite-state grammar cannot even produce a sentence
    as one of a list,
    it is not adequate as a model of that language,
    at least as far as that sentence goes.
    <p>
    </p>
    Chomsky shows that there is,
    in fact,
    a large, significant class of sentences that
    his "grammars" can list,
    but which the finite-state grammars cannot list.
    Chomsky presents this as
    very strong evidence that
    his grammars will make better models
    of language
    than finite-state grammars can.
    </p>
    <h2>Other considerations</h2>
    <p>
    In addition to simplifying the math, Chomsky has two other good
    reasons to avoid dealing with meaning.
    A second reason is that
    semantics is a treacherously dangerous field of study.
    If you can make your point,
    and don't have to drag in semantics,
    you are crazy to do otherwise.
    Sentence (42), above,
    is just one example of the pitfalls
    that await those tackle who semantic issues.
    It echoes
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images">a famous Magritte<a>
    and translates to "This is not a true sentence".
    </p>
    <p>
    A third reason is that most linguists of Chomsky's time
    were Bloomfieldians.
    Bloomfield defined language as follows:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    The totality of utterances that can be made in a speech
    community is the <b>language</b>
    of that speech-community.<a id="footnote-6-ref" href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    Bloomfield says "totality" instead of "set"
    and "utterances" instead of "strings",
    but for our purposes in this post the idea is the same --
    the definition is without regard to the meaning
    of the members of the set.<a id="footnote-7-ref" href="#footnote-7">[7]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    Bloomfield's omission of semantics is not accidental.
    Bloomfield wanted to establish linguistics as a
    science, and for Bloomfield
    claiming to know the meaning of
    a sentence was dangerously close to
    claiming to be able to read minds.
    You cannot base your work on mind-reading and expect people to
    believe that you are doing science.
    Bloomfield therefore suggested avoiding,
    totally if possible,
    any discussion of semantics.
    Most readers of Chomsky's paper in 1956 were Bloomfieldians --
    Chomsky has studied under a Bloomfieldian,
    and originally was seen as one.<a id="footnote-8-ref" href="#footnote-8">[8]</a>
    By excluding semantics from his own model of language,
    Chomsky was making his paper maximally acceptable to
    his readership.
    </p>
    <h2>Semantics sneaks back in</h2>
    <p>
    But you did not have to read Chomsky's mind,
    or predict the future,
    to see that Chomsky
    was a lot more interested in semantics than
    Bloomfield was.
    Already in "Three Models",
    he is suggesting that his model is superior to
    its predecessors,
    because his model,
    when an utterance is ambiguous,
    produces multiple derivations to reflect that.
    Even better, these multiple derivations "look" like natural representations
    of the difference between meanings.<a id="footnote-9-ref" href="#footnote-9">[9]</a>
    These insights,
    which dropped effortlessly out of Chomsky's grammars,
    were well beyond what the finite-state models were providing.
    </p>
    <p>
    By itself,
    Chomsky's argument, that his grammars were better
    because they could list more sentences,
    might have carried the day.
    With the demonstration that his grammars could do
    more than list sentences,
    but also could proivde insight into the structure and semantics
    of sentences,
    Chomsky's case was compelling.
    Young linguists wanted theoretical tools with this
    kind of power and those few
    older linguists not convinced struggled to find
    reasons why the young linguists could not
    have what they wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
    In later years,
    Chomsky made it quite clear what his position was:
    <blockquote>
    [...] it would be absurd to develop
    a general syntactic theory
    without assigning an absolutely
    crucial role to semantic considerations,
    since obviously the necessity to support
    semantic interpretation is one of the primary
    requirements
    that the structures
    generated by the syntactic component of a grammar
    must meet.<a id="footnote-10-ref" href="#footnote-10">[10]</a>
    </blockquote>
    Compare this to Bloomfield:
    <blockquote>
    The statement of meanings is therefore the weak point in
    language-study, and will remain so until human knowledge
    advances very far beyond its present state. In practice, we define the
    meaning of a linguistic form, wherever we can, in terms of some
    other science.<a id="footnote-11-ref" href="#footnote-11">[11]</a>
    </blockquote>
    It is easy to see why linguists found Chomsky's
    expansion of their horizons irresistable.
    <p>
    </p>
    <h2>The tradition</h2>
    <p>Given the immense prestige of "Three models",
    it is unsurprising that it was closely studied by
    the pioneers of parsing theory.
    Unfortunately, what they picked up was not
    Chomsky's emphasis on the overriding importance
    of semantics,
    but the narrow definition of language
    that Chomsky had adopted from Bloomfield
    for tactical purposes.
    In the classic Aho and Ullman 1972 textbook, we have
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    A language over an alphabet &Sigma;
    is a set of strings over an alphabet &Sigma;.
    This definition encompasses almost everyone's notion of a language.<a id="footnote-12-ref" href="#footnote-12">[12]</a>
    </blockquote>
    If this "encompasses" my notion of a language,
    it does so only in the sense that an avalanche encompasses
    a skier.
    </p>
    <p>
    From 1988, thirty years after Chomsky,
    here is another authoritative textbook of Parsing Theory
    defining "language":
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      A set V is an alphabet (or a vocabulary) if it is finite and
      nonempty.
      The elements
      of an alphabet V are called the symbols (or letters or characters) of
      V.
      A language L over V is any subset of the free monoid V*.
      The elements
      of a language L are called sentences of L.<a id="footnote-13-ref" href="#footnote-13">[13]</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The language is now that of abstract algebra,
    but the idea is the same -- pure Bloomfield.<a id="footnote-14-ref" href="#footnote-14">[14]</a>
    </p>
    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>
    Interesting, you might be saying, that
    some textbook definitions are not everything they could be,
    but is there any effect on the daily practice of
    programming?
    </p>
    <p>
    The languages human beings use with each other
    are powerful,
    varied, flexible and endlessly retargetable.
    The parsers we use to communicate with computers
    are restrictive, repetitive in form,
    difficult to reprogram,
    and prohibitively hard to retarget.
    Is this because humans have a preternatural language ability?
    </p>
    <p>
    Or is there something wrong with the way we
    go about talking to computers?
    How the Theory of Parsing literature defines the term
    "language" may seem
    of only pedantic interest.
    But I will argue that it is a mistake which has everything
    to do with the limits of modern computer languages.
    <p>
    What is the problem with defining a language as a set of strings?
    Here is one example of how the textbook definition
    affects daily practice.
    Call one grammar <tt>SENSE</tt>:
    </p>
    <pre id="g-structure-op"><tt>
      SENSE ::= E
      E ::= E + T
      E ::= T
      T ::= T * P
      T ::= P
      P ::= number
    </tt></pre>
    <p>
    And call another grammar <tt>STRING</tt>:
    </p>
    <pre id="g-string-op"><tt>
      STRING ::= E
      E  ::= P OP E
      OP ::= '*'
      OP ::= '+'
      P  ::= number
    </tt></pre>
    <p>
    If you define a language as a set of strings,
    both
    <tt>SENSE</tt>
    and <tt>STRING</tt>
    recognize the same language.
    But it's a very different story if you
    take the intended meaning as
    that of traditional arithmetic expressions,
    and consider
    the meaning of the two grammars.
    </p>
    <p>
    <tt>SENSE</tt>
    recognizes the associativity and precedence of the two operators --
    the parse tree it produces could be used directly to evaluate an arithmetic
    expression and the answer would always be correct.
    The parse tree that <tt>STRING</tt> produces, if evaluated directly,
    will very often produce a wrong answer -- it does not capture
    the structure of an arithmetic expression.
    In order to produce correct results,
    the output of <tt>STRING</tt> could be put through a second phase,
    but that is the point --
    <tt>STRING</tt> left crucial parts of the job of parsing undone,
    and either some other logic does the job <tt>STRING</tt> did not do,
    or a wrong answer results.
    <p>
    It is much easier to write a parser for <tt>STRING</tt>
    than it is for <tt>SENSE</tt>.
    Encouraged by a theory that minimizes the
    difference,
    many implementations attempt to make do with <tt>STRING</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
    But that is not the worst of it.
    The idea that a language is a set of strings
    has guided research,
    and steered it away from the most promising lines.
    How, I hope to explain in the future.<a id="footnote-15-ref" href="#footnote-15">[15]</a>

      In this post I am treating the "Three models" paper
      as the "first"
      work of Chomskyan linguistics.
      Other choices can be justified.
      The next year, 1957,
      Chomsky published a book covering the same material: <cite>Syntactic Structures</cite>.
      <cite>Syntactic Structures</cite>
      was much more accessible,
      and attracted much more attention --
      the Chomskyan revolution did not really begin before
      it came out.
      On the other hand,
      both of these draw their material from Chomsky's
      1000-page
      <cite>Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory</cite>,
      which was completed in June 1955.
      But <cite>Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory</cite>
      was not published until 1975
      and then only in part.

    As an aside,
    Grune and Jacobs often depart from the "just stick to the math"

    They often give the history and motivation behind the math.

      What do parser
      users want?
      What makes a parser<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>
      successful?
      In this post I will look at
      one aspect of
      that question,
      in light of an episode in
      the history of parsing.
    </p>
    <h2>Irons 1961</h2>
    <p>
      The first paper
      fully describing a parser was Irons 1961<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>.
      The Irons parser was what is called "general",
      meaning that it can parse all of
      the "context-free grammars".
      That makes it
      far more powerful than most parsers
      in practical use today.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Irons algorithm was not always fast in the general case.
      Irons 1961 used backtracking
      to achieve its power,
      so it would go exponential for many useful grammars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the grammars Irons 1961 could not parse quickly
      were those containing the all-important arithmetic expressions.
      Irons 1961 gave way to recursive descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recursive descent (RD) in its pure form,
      could not parse arithmetic expressions at all,
      but it could be customized with procedural code.
      That is, it could call specialized parsers which were
      reliably fast for specific sections of the input.
      The Irons parser was declarative,
      and not easy to cusomtize.
    </p>
    <h2>Raw power versus useful power</h2>
    <p>
      The contest between Irons parsing and recursive descent took place
      before the theory for analyzing algorithms was fully formed.<a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>
      In retrospect, we can say that,
      except in specialized uses,
      an acceptable parser for most practical uses
      must be linear or quasi-linear.<a id="footnote-4-ref" href="#footnote-4">[4]</a>
      That is,
      the "useful power" of a parser is the class
      of grammars that it will parse in quasi-linear time.<a id="footnote-5-ref" href="#footnote-5">[5]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Useful power turns out to be more important,
      in practice,
      than raw power.
      Recursive descent won out over the
      Irons algorithm because,
      while the Irons algorithm had vastly more raw power,
      RD had slightly more "useful power".
    <p>
      It is nice to have raw power as well -- it means an algorithm can take on some specialized tasks.
      And raw power provides a kind of "soft failure" debugging mode for grammars with,
      for example, unintended ambiguities.
      But, in the eyes of the programming community, the more important measure of a parser
      is its useful power -- the class of grammars that it will parse at quasi-linear speed.
    </p>
    <h2>Stating the obvious?</h2>
    <p>
    That useful power is more important than raw power may seem,
    in retrospect,
    obvious.
    But in fact, it remains a live issue.
    In practice raw power and useful power are often confused.
    The parsing literature is not always as helpful as it could be:
    it can be hard to determine what the
    useful power of an algorithm is.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Irons experiment with raw power is often repeated,
      in hopes of a different result.
      Very often,
      a new algorithm is a hybrid of two others:
      an algorithm with a lot of raw power,
      but which can go quadratic or worse;
      and a fast algorithm which lacks power.
      When the power of the fast algorithm fails,
      the hybrid algorithm switches over
      to the algorithm with raw power.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a sort of
      cross-breeding of algorithms.
      The hope is that the hybrid algorithm has the best
      features of each of its parents.
      This works a lot better in botany than it does in parsing.
      Once you have a successful cross in a plant,
      you can breed from the successful hybrid
      and expect good things to happen.
      In botany,
      the individual crosses can have an extremely high
      failure rate,
      and cross-breeding can still succeed.
      But it's different when you cross algorithms:
      Even after you've succeeded with one parse,
      the next parse from your hybrid is a fresh new toss of the dice.

      Even the term "analysis of algorithms" did not exist until 1969:

        For more about "linear" and "quasi-linear",
	including definitions,
	see
        <a href="https://jeffreykegler.github.io/personal/timeline_v3">
          V3 of my "Parsing: A Timeline"</a>,
        in particular its 'Term: linear' section.

	While it is clearly the consensus among practitioners and theoreticians
	that, for parsing,
	practical time is quasi-linear or better,
	there are those who argue that worse-than-quasi-linear parsers
	are often the right ones for the job,
	and that research on them has been unwisely neglected.
	The dissenters are not without a case:
	For example, in natural language, while sentences are in theory
	infinite in length, in practice their average size is fixed.
	And while very long difficult-to-parse sentences do occur in some texts, such as
	older ones, it is normal for a human reader
	to have to spend extra time on them.
	So it may be unreasonable to insist that a parsing algorithm be
	quasi-linear in this application.

      Marpa's useful power is LR-regular,
      which properly contains
      every class of grammar in practical use: regular expressions,
      LALR,
      LL(k) for all k,
      LR(k) for all k,
      and the LL-regular grammars.
      <!-- For LLR, see Theorem 3, p. 448 in
      https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/6126669,
      Nijholt, "On the parsing of LL-regular grammars" -->
