      -->
      "First we ask, what impact will our algorithm have on the parsing
      done in production compilers for existing programming languages?
      The answer is, practically none." -- Jay Earley's Ph.D thesis, p. 122.
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the above quote, the inventor of the Earley parsing
      algorithm poses a question.
      Is his algorithm fast enough for a production compiler?  His answer is a
      stark "no".
    </p>
    <p>
    This is the verdict on Earley's that you often
    hear repeated today, 45 years later.
    When the field is difficult,
    any verdict tends to be repeated far more than it is re-examined,
    and this one comes from the inventor himself.
    Add to that that the field has fallen out of fashion
    and off the funding radar,
    and it is no surprise that many find it unnecessary to give Earley's
    algorithm a second look.
    </p>
    <p>But in the pase 45 years,
    the technology has changed beyond recognition.
    And, out of fashion or not, researchers
    have made several important improvements to Earley's.
    It's time to take another look.
    <h3>Time complexity and speed</h3>
    <p>When programmers talk about time efficiency, they do it in two ways:
    time complexity and speed.
      Speed is fairly simple.
      It's how fast the algorithm is against the clock.
      The clock can be a bit abstract.
      To make comparison easy,
      the clock ticks could be, for example, weighted instructions
      on some convenient and mutually-agreed architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time Earley was writing, programmers had discovered that simply comparing
      speeds,
      even on abstract clocks, was not enough.
      Computers were improving so quickly that a speed result
      that was clearly significant when a comparison was made
      might soon be unimportant .
      So that researchers could
      make statements about time efficiency that would remain true
      over the decades,
      they created the idea of time complexity.
    </p>
    <p>Time complexity is measured using several notations, but the most
      common is big-O notation.
      Here's the idea:
      Assume we are comparion two algorithms, Algorithm A and Algorithm B.
      Assume that algorithm A uses 42 weighted instructions for each input symbol.
      Assume that algorithm B uses 1792 weighted instructions for each input symbol.
      Where the count of input symbols is N,
      A's speed is 42*N, and B's is 1792*N.
      But the time complexity of both is O(N) -- the big-O notation throws
      away the "constant factor".
    </p>
    <p>It often happens that algorithms we need to compare for time efficiency
      have the same time complexity,
      but differents speeds.
      And it sometimes happens that this difference is relevant.
      When this happens, the slower algorithm is accused of having
      a "high constant factor".
    </p>
    <h3>OK, now about that constant factor</h3>
    <h3>Other considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Error diagnosis.
      </li>
      <li>Readability.
      </li>
      <li>Maintainabilty.
      </li></ul>
    <h3>For more about Marpa</h3>
    <p>Earley goes on to note that hand-written parsers can clearly be faster.
      At the time Earley wrote, this was the state of the art for production compilers and
      the world was such that languages remained static and hand-written approaches were
      reasonable.
      Today, hand-written parsers are once again the state of the art for production compilers,
      though expectations about the size and stabiity of languages,
      and perceptions about the desirability of large amounts of complex hand-crafted code,
      has changed considerably.
      But the speed remains the obstacle to anything better.  Or does it?
    </p>
    <p>Earley, writing in 1968, took it for granted that a hand-written parser
      was a highly optimized parser.  Four and a half decades of practice have taught
      us that in fact it is hard to keep complex hand-written parsers correct
      for evolving languages, and that they are in fact often slow.
      But let's assume we don't know that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's assume the competitors to Earley's are one hundred times as fast.
      So, slower by a factor of hundred means too slow, right?
      Wrong.
      The tendency is to repeat clear verdicts,
      rather than re-examine them,
      particularly if the field is complex.
      And parsing theory is not just complex.
      but it's out of fashion and off the funding radar.
      Which means nobody has thought about the relevance of Moore's Law.

</center>
  <p>
      <!--
      marpa_r2_html_fmt --no-added-tag-comment --no-ws-ok-after-start-tag
      -->
    </p>
    <p>
      Marpa's SLIF (scanless interface)
      allows an application to parse directly from any BNF grammar.
      Marpa parses vast classes of grammars in linear time,
      including all those classes currently in practical use.
      With
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-R2">
        its latest release</a>,
      Marpa::R2's SLIF
      also allows an application to intermix
      its own custom lexing and parsing logic
      with Marpa's,
      and to switch back and forth between them.
      This means,
      among other things,
      that Marpa's SLIF can now
      do procedural parsing.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is procedural parsing?
      Procedural parsing is parsing using
      ad hoc code in a procedural language.
      The opposite of procedural parsing is declarative parsing
      -- parsing driven by some kind of formal description
      of the grammar.
      Procedural parsing
      may be described as what you do when you've given up
      on your parsing algorithm.
      Dissatisfaction with parsing theory
      has left modern programmers accustomed to procedural parsing.
      And in fact some problems are best tackled with procedural parsing.
    </p>
    <h3>An example</h3>
    <p>
      One such problem is parsing Perl-style here-documents.
      Peter Stuifzand has tackled this using
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-2.052000">
        the
        just-released version of Marpa::R2</a>.
      For those unfamiliar, Perl allows documents to be incorporated
      into its source files in line-oriented fashion as "here-documents".
      Here-documents can be used in expressions.
      The syntax to do this is very handy, if a little strange.
      For example,
    </p>
    <blockquote><pre>
say &lt;&lt;ENDA, &lt;&lt;ENDB, &lt;&lt;ENDC; say &lt;&lt;ENDD;
a
ENDA
b
ENDB
c
ENDC
d
ENDD</pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      starts with a single line declaring four here-documents spread out
      over two
      <tt>say</tt>
      statements.
      The expressions of the form
    </p><blockquote><pre>&lt;&lt;ENDX</pre></blockquote><p>
      are here-document expressions.
      <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>
      is the heredoc operator.
      The string which follows it (in this example,
      <tt>ENDA</tt>,
      <tt>ENDB</tt>, etc.) is the heredoc terminator string --
      the string that will signal end
      of body of the here-document.
      The body of the here-documents follow, in order, over the next eight lines.
      More details of here-document syntax, with examples, can be found
      in
      <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html#Quote-Like-Operators">the
        Perl documentation</a>.
    </p>
    <p>All of this poses quite a challenge to a parser-lexer combination,
      which is one reason I chose it as an example --
      to illustrate that the Marpa's SLIF support for procedural parsing can
      handle genuinely difficult cases.
      There are a few ways Marpa could approach this.
      The one
      Peter Stuifzand chose was to
      to read the
      here-document's body as the value of the terminator in
      each
      <tt>&lt;&lt;ENDX</tt>
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strategy works this way:
      Marpa allows the application to mark certain lexemes as "pause" lexemes.
      Whenever a "pause" lexeme is encountered, Marpa's internal scanning stops,
      and control is handed over to the application.
      In this case, the application is set up to pause after every newline,
      and before the terminator in every here-document expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      While reading the line containing the four here-document expressions,
      Marpa's SLIF pauses and resumes five times -- once for each here-document expression,
      then once for the final newline.
      Details can be found in compact form in the heavily commented code
      in
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/jeffreykegler/5431739">this
        Github gist</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Marpa as a better procedural parser</h3>
    <p>So far I've talked in terms of Marpa "allowing" procedural parsing.
      In fact, there can be much more to it.
      Marpa can make procedural parsing easier and more accurate.
    </p>
    <p>Marpa knows, at every point, which rules it is recognizing, and how far it
      is into them.
      Marpa also knows which new rules the grammar expects, and which terminals.
      The procedural parsing logic can consult this information to guide its decisions.
      Marpa can provide your procedural parsing logic with radar,
      as well as the option to use a very smart autopilot.
    </p>

</center>

      <!--
      marpa_r2_html_fmt --no-added-tag-comment --no-ws-ok-after-start-tag
      -->
    </p>
    <p>In 1980, George Copeland wrote
      <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=802685">
    an article</a>
    titled "What if Mass Storage were Free?".
      Costs of mass storage were showing signs
      that they might fall dramatically.
      Copeland, as a thought exercise, took this trend to its extreme.
      Among other things, he predicted that deletion would become
      unnecessary, and in fact, undesirable.
    </p>
    <p>Copeland's
      thought experiment has proved prophetic.
      For many purposes, mass storage is treated as if it were free.
      For example, you probably retrieved this blog post from a server
      provided to me at no charge, in the hope
      that I might write and upload something interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until now languages were high-cost efforts.
      Worse, language projects ran a high risk of disappointment,
      up to and including total failure.
      I believe those days are coming to an end.
    </p>
    <h3>Small languages, shaped to the problem domain</h3>
    <p>What if whenever you needed a new language, poof, it was there?
      You would be encouraged to tackle each problem domain with
      a new language dedicated to dealing with that domain.
      Since each language is no larger than its problem domain,
      learning a language would be essentially the same as learning
      the problem domain.
      The incremental effort required to learn the language
      itself would head toward zero.
    </p>
    <h3>No more language bloat</h3>
    <p>Language bloat would end.
      Currently, the risk and cost of developing languages
      make it imperative to extend the ones we have.
      Free languages mean fewer reasons to add features
      to existing languages.
    </p>
    <h3>No more search for THE perfect language</h3>
    <p>
      No language is perfect for all tasks.
      But because the high cost of languages favors
      large, general-purpose languages,
      we are compelled to try for perfection anyway.
      Ironically, we are often making the language worse,
      and we know it.
    </p>
    <h3>A world full of perfect languages</h3>
    <p>An older sense of the word perfect is
      "having all the properties or qualities requisite to its nature and kind".
      The C language might be called perfect in this sense.
      C lacks a lot of features that are highly desirable in most contexts.
      But for programming that is portable
      and close to the hardware,
      the C language is perfect or close to it.
      If languages were free, this is the kind of perfection
      that we would seek --
      languages precisely fitted to their domain,
      so that adding to them cannot make them better.
    </p>
    <h3>Moving toward free</h3>
    <p>
      My own effort to contribute to 
      a fall in the cost of languages is the Marpa parser.
      Marpa produces a reasonable parser
      for every language you can write in BNF.
      If the BNF is for a grammar in any of the classes currently in practical
      use, the parser Marpa produces will have linear speed.
      In one case, using Marpa,
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/4447349">a targeted language</a>
      was written
      in less than an hour.
      <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/2013/01/a-language-for-writing-languages.html">
        More typically</a>, Marpa reduce the time needed to create new languages to hours.
    </p>
    <p>As one example of going from "impossible" to "easy",
      I have written a drop-in solution to an example in the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Gang
        of Four book</a>.
      The Gang of Four described a language
      and its interpretation,
      but they did not include a parser.
      Creating a parser
      to fit their example would have been
      impossibly hard when the Gang of Four wrote.
      Using Marpa, it is easy.
      The parser can be found in
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/03/bnf_to_ast.html">this

        elsewhere</a>
      Yegge says that
      "[t]ragically, the only [Go4] pattern that can help code get smaller
      (Interpreter) is utterly ignored by programmers".
      (The
      <i>Design Patterns</i>
      book has four authors,
      and is often called the Gang of Four book, or Go4.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, under various names and definitions, the
      Interpreter Pattern and its close relatives and/or identical twins
      are widely cited,
      much argued and highly praised<a href="#NOTE1">[1]</a>.
          As they should be.
          Languages are the most powerful and flexible design pattern of all.
          A language can include all, and only, the concepts relevent
          to your domain.
          A language can allow you to relate them in all, and only, the appropriate ways.
          A language can identify errors with pinpoint precision,
          hide implementation details,
          allow invisible "drop-in" enhancements, etc., etc., etc.
        </p>
    <p>
      In fact languages are so powerful and flexible,
      that their use is pretty much universal.
      The choice is not whether or not to use a language to solve
      the problem,
      but whether to use
      a general-purpose language,
      or a domain-specific language.
      Put another way,
      if you decide not to use a language targeted
      to your domain,
      it almost always means that you
      are choosing to use another language that is not specifically
      fitted to your domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why then, is the Interpreter Pattern so little used?
      Why does Yegge call it a practical joke?
    </p>
    <h3>There's a problem</h3>
    <p>The problem with the Interpreter Pattern is that you must
      turn your language into an AST --
      that is,
      you must parse it somehow.
      Simplifying the language can help here.
      But if the point is to be simple at the expense of power
      and flexibility,
      you might as well
      stick with the other 22 design patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand,
      creating a parser for anything but the simplest languages
      has been a time-consuming effort,
      and one of a kind known for disappointing results.
      In fact,
      language development efforts run
      a real risk of total failure.
    </p>
    <p>How did the Go4 deal with this?
      They defined the problem away.
      They stated that the parsing issue was separate from the
      Interpreter Pattern, which was limited to what you did with the AST
      once you'd somehow come up with one.
    </p>
    <p>
      But AST's don't (so to speak) grow on trees.
      You have to get one from somewhere.
      In their example, the Go4 simply built an AST in their code,
      node by node.
      In doing this, they bypassed the BNF and the problem of parsing.
      But they also bypassed their language and the whole point
      of the Interpreter Pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which is why Yegge characterized the chapter as a practical joke.
      And why other programming techniques and patterns are almost
      always preferred to the Interpreter Pattern.
    </p>
    <h3>Finding that one missing piece</h3>
    <p>So that's how the Go4 left things.
      A potentially great programming technique,
      made almost useless because
      of a missing piece.
      There was no easy, general, and practical way to generate AST's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few expected that to change.
      I was more optimistic than most.
      In 2007 I embarked on a full-time project:
      to create a parser based on Earley's algorithm.
      I was sure that it would fulfill two of the criteria --
      it would be easy to use, and it would be general.
      As for practical -- well, a lot of parsing problems
      are small, and a lot of applications don't require a lot
      of speed, and for these I expected the result to be good enough.
    </p>
    <p>What I didn't realize was that
      all of the problems preventing
      Earley's from seeing real, practical use
      has already been solved in the academic literature.
      I was not alone in not having put the picture together.
      The people who had solved the problems
      had focused on two disjoint sets of issues,
      and were unaware of each other's
      work.
      In 1991, in the Netherlands,
      the mathematican Joop Leo had
      arrived at an astounding result --
      he showed how to make Earley's run in linear time for LR-regular grammars.
      LR-regular is a vast class of grammars.
      It easily includes, as a proper subset, every class of grammar now
      in practical use -- regular expressions, PEG, recursive descent,
      the LALR on which yacc and bison are based, you name it.
      (For those into the math,
      LR-regular includes LR(k)
      for all <i>k</i>,
      and therefore LL(k),
      also for all <i>k</i>.)
      </p>
      <p>
      Leo's mathematical approach did not address some nagging practical issues,
      foremost among them the handling of nullable rules and symbols.
      But ten years later in Canada,
      Aycock and Horspool focused on exactly these issues,
      and solved them.
      Aycock-Horspool
      seem to have been unaware of Leo's earlier result.
      The time complexity of the Aycock-Horspool
      algorithm was essentially that of
      Earley's original algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of Leo's work,
      for any grammar in any class currently in practical use,
      an Earley's parser could be fast.
      If only it could be combined with the approach
      of Aycock and Horspool, I realized,
      Leo's speeds could be available in an everyday programming tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      In changing the Earley parse engine,
      Aycock-Horspool and Leo had branched off in different directions.
      It was not obvious that their approaches could be combined, much less how.
      And in fact, the combination of the two is not a simple algorithm.
      But it is fast,
      and the new Marpa parse engine makes full information
      about the state of the parse (rules recognized, symbols expected, etc.)
      available as it proceeds.
      This is very convenient for, among other things, error reporting.
    </p>
    <h3>Eureka and all that</h3>
    <p>The result is an algorithm which parses anything
      you can write in BNF and
      does it in times considered optimal in practice.
      Unlike recursive descent, you don't have to write out the parser --
      Marpa generates a parser for you, from the BNF.
      It's the easy, "drop-in" solution that the Go4 needed and did not have.
      A reworking of the Go4 example, with the missing parser added,
      is in
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/03/bnf_to_ast.html">a

<h3>Mon, 11 Mar 2013</h3>

  <p>
      <!--
      marpa_r2_html_fmt --no-added-tag-comment --no-ws-ok-after-start-tag
      -->
      The latest version of
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2">
      Marpa</a> takes parsing "whipitupitude" one step further.
      You can now go straight from
      a BNF description of your language,
      and an input string,
      to an abstract syntax tree (AST).
    </p>
    <p>To illustrate, I'll use an example from the
      Gang of Four's (Go4's) chapter
      on the Interpreter pattern.
      (It's pages 243-255 of the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">
      <em>Design Patterns</em> book</a>.)
      The Go4 knew of no easy general way to go from BNF to AST,
      so they dealt with that part of the interpreter problem
      by punting --
      they did not even try to parse the input string.
      Instead they constructed the BNF they'd just presented and
      constructed an AST directly in their code.
    </p>
    <p>The reason the Go4 didn't know of an easy,
    generally-applicable way
      to parse their example was that
      there was none.
      Now there is.
      In this post, Marpa will take us
      quickly and easily
      from BNF to AST.
      (Full code for this post can
      be found in
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/jeffreykegler/5121769">a Github gist</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The Go4's example was a simple boolean expression language,
      whose primary input was
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
true and x or y and not x
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here, in full, is the BNF for an slight elaboration of the
      Go4 example.
      It is written in the DSL for Marpa's Scanless interface (SLIF DSL),
      and includes specifications for building the AST.
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
:default ::= action =&gt; ::array

:start ::= &lt;boolean expression&gt;
&lt;boolean expression&gt; ::=
       &lt;variable&gt; bless =&gt; variable
     | '1' bless =&gt; constant
     | '0' bless =&gt; constant
     | ('(') &lt;boolean expression&gt; (')') action =&gt; ::first bless =&gt; ::undef
    || ('not') &lt;boolean expression&gt; bless =&gt; not
    || &lt;boolean expression&gt; ('and') &lt;boolean expression&gt; bless =&gt; and
    || &lt;boolean expression&gt; ('or') &lt;boolean expression&gt; bless =&gt; or

&lt;variable&gt; ~ [[:alpha:]] &lt;zero or more word characters&gt;
&lt;zero or more word characters&gt; ~ [\w]*

:discard ~ whitespace
whitespace ~ [\s]+
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This syntax should be fairly transparent.
      In previous posts I've given
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/01/dsl_simpler2.html">
        a tutorial</a>,
      and a
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/01/announce_scanless.html">a
        mini-tutorial</a>.
      And of course, the interface is
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-2.048000/pod/Scanless/DSL.pod">
        documented</a>.
    </p>
    <p>For those skimming, here are a few quick comments on less-obvious features.
      To guide Marpa in building the AST,
      the BNF statements have
      <tt>action</tt>
      and
      <tt>bless</tt>
      adverbs.
      The
      <tt>bless</tt>
      adverbs indicate a Perl class into which the node should be
      blessed.
      This is convenient for using an object-oriented approach with the AST.
      The
      <tt>action</tt>
      adverb tells Marpa how to build the nodes.
      "<tt>action =&gt; ::array</tt>" means the result of the rule should
      be an array containing its child nodes.
      "<tt>action =&gt; ::first</tt>" means the result of the rule should just be
      its first child.
      Many of the child symbols,
      especially literal strings of a structural nature,
      are in parentheses.
      This makes them invisible to
      the semantics.
    </p>
    <p>A
      <tt>:default</tt>
      pseudo-rule specifies the defaults -- in this case the
      "<tt>action =&gt; ::array</tt>" adverb setting.
      The
      <tt>:start</tt>
      pseudo-rule specified the start symbol.
      The <tt>:discard</tt> pseudo-rule
      indicates that whitespace is to be discarded.
    </p>
    <p>The Go4 did not deal with precedence.
      In their example, the input string is fully parenthesized,
      even though its priorities are the standard ones.
      I've eliminated the parentheses, because
      the standard precedence is implemented in SLIF grammar.
      The double vertical bar ("<tt>||</tt>") is a "loosen" operator --
      an alternative after "loosen" operator will be
      at a looser precedence than the one before.
      Alternatives separated by a single bar are at the same precedence.
    </p><h3>Creating the AST</h3><p>
      Creating the AST is simple.
      First, we use Marpa to turn the above DSL for boolean expressions
      into a parser.
      (We'd saved the SLIF DSL source in the string
      <tt>$rules</tt>.)
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
my $grammar = Marpa::R2::Scanless::G->new(
    {   bless_package => 'Boolean_Expression',
        source        => \$rules,
    }   
);  
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Next we define a closure that uses
      <tt>$grammar</tt>
      to turn
      BNF into AST's.
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
sub bnf_to_ast {
    my ($bnf) = @_;
    my $recce = Marpa::R2::Scanless::R->new( { grammar => $grammar } );
    $recce->read( \$bnf );
    my $value_ref = $recce->value();
    if ( not defined $value_ref ) {
        die "No parse for $bnf";
    }
    return ${$value_ref};
} ## end sub bnf_to_ast
</pre>
    </blockquote><p>
Where <tt>$bnf</tt> is our input string,
we run it as follows:
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
my $ast1 = bnf_to_ast($bnf);
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>The AST</h3>
    <p>If we use Data::Dumper to examine the AST,
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
say Data::Dumper::Dumper($ast1) if $verbose_flag;
</pre>
    </blockquote><p>
      we see this:
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
$VAR1 = bless( [
                 bless( [
                          bless( [
                                   'true'
                                 ], 'Boolean_Expression::variable' ),
                          bless( [
                                   'x'
                                 ], 'Boolean_Expression::variable' )
                        ], 'Boolean_Expression::and' ),
                 bless( [
                          bless( [
                                   'y'
                                 ], 'Boolean_Expression::variable' ),
                          bless( [
                                   bless( [
                                            'x'
                                          ], 'Boolean_Expression::variable' )
                                 ], 'Boolean_Expression::not' )
                        ], 'Boolean_Expression::and' )
               ], 'Boolean_Expression::or' );
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Processing the AST</h3>
    <p>In their example,
    the Go4 processed their AST in several ways:
    straight evaluation, copying,
      and substitution of the occurrences of a variable in one boolean expression
      by another boolean expression.
      It is obvious that the AST above is the computational
      equivalent of the Go4's AST,
      but for the sake of completeness I carry out the same operations
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/jeffreykegler/5121769">in the Github gist</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      AST creation via Marpa's SLIF is self-hosting --
      the SLIF DSL is parsed into an AST,
      and a parser created by interpreting the AST.
      The Marpa SLIF DSL source file in this post,
      that describes boolean expressions,
      was itself turned into an AST on its way to becoming a parser
      that turns boolean expressions into AST's.
