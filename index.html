      -->
      I've written a grammar in Marpa's new BNF interface,
      to parse Marpa's new BNF interface.
      In the 70's, when I learned parsing theory,
      this was a very fashionable thing to do, perhaps because
      yacc had done it,
      in Appendix B of
      <a href="http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/yacc/">
        the original 1975 paper</a>.
      By 1979, Hoftstadter's book Godel-Escher-Bach (GEB) was out,
      and the next year it took the Pulitzer for
      General Nonfiction.
      Self-description, recursion, self-reference, self-embedding,
      you
      (preferably
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autological_word">autologically</a>)
      name it,
      these things were all the rage.
    </p>
    <p>Reading code
    that is at once both self-example and self-description
    still holds a certain magic for me.
      Regular expressions cannot describe themselves.
      Recursive descent parsers are hand-written
      in another general-purpose language,
      so there can be no concise self-description.
      Ironically, yacc actually cannot parse its own description language.
      ("Ironically" is the word used in the paper.)
      Like almost all useful grammars, yacc's description language
      goes beyond the capabilities of yacc's LALR parser,
      and a lexer hack is needed to make the code in Appendix B work.
    </p>
    <p>Marpa is a general BNF parser and requires no special hacks
    to parse the following efficiently:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
rules ::= rule+ action => do_rules

priority_rule ::= lhs op_declare priorities

</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    The conventions are standard or transparent.
    The "<tt>::=</tt>" symbol separates the left and right hand sides of rules.
    The "<tt>|</tt>" symbol separates alternative right hand sides.
    The "<tt>*</tt>" and
    "<tt>+</tt>" are quantifiers, similar to those in regular expressions,
    and indicate, respectively, zero or more repetitions and one or more repetitions
    of the preceding symbol.
    Adverbs take the form "<tt>keyword => value</tt>",
    and indicate semantics or the style of sequence separation.

    <p>
      Self-parsing compiler compilers ruled the earth
      in the age of bellbottoms.
      Self-parsing has lasted better, but not by much.
      When some years I wrote a self-describing language as an interface to
      Marpa, it seemed to confuse people.
      They wondered what Marpa did --
      parsing your own description did not seem to be
      about <b>doing</b> anything.
      These days my examples feature a lot of calculators.
      ("Ironically", Hofstadter seems to have had the same problem with
      GEB -- he felt that
      people did not understand what his book was saying --
      even those who liked it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      But ideas from Larry Wall and Peter Stuifzand
      have re-ignited my interest in self-parsing.
      And this time the self-parsing parser was written
      with a specific purpose.
      I plan to enhance this language.
      I have found that the convenience of this interface
      more than compensates for the circular
      dependency issues.
      The BNF source in this post is
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/source/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-2.023_010/lib/Marpa/R2/meta/Stuifzand.bnf">
      the source</a>
      for its own parser,
      and I plan to use it
      to produce improved versions
      of itself.

<center><a name="error"> <h2>A Marpa DSL tutorial: Error reporting made easy</h2> </a>
</center>
  <p>
      <!--
      marpa_r2_html_fmt --no-added-tag-comment --no-ws-ok-after-start-tag
      -->
      Using
      Marpa's facilities for error reporting,
      a quickly written domain-specific language can,
      as of its first draft,
      have error reporting whose helpfulness and precision exceeds
      that of carefully hand-crafted production compilers.
      This post will show how, with an example.
    </p><p>
      Two techniques will be used.
      First and most basic,
      Marpa's knowledge of the point
      at which the parse
      can no longer proceed is 100% accurate and immediate.
      This is not the case with yacc-derived parsers,
      and is not the case with most recursive descent parsers.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, even Marpa's 100% accuracy in pinpointing
      the problem location is only accuracy
      in the technical sense -- it cannot take into account what the
      programmer intended.
      A second technique allows the programmer to double-check his
      intentions against what the parser has actually seen.
      Marpa can tell the programmer exactly how it thinks
      the input parsed, up to the point at which it could no
      longer proceed.
      The Marpa parser can report the answer to questions like
    </p><blockquote><p>
        "What was the last statement you successfully parsed?"<br>
        "What was the last expression you successfully parsed?"<br>
        "What was the last arithmetic expression you successfully parsed?"<br>
        "Where did the last successfully parsed block start?  End?"<br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>The language</h3>
    <p>
      To focus on the logic of the error reporting,
      I looked for a language that was error-prone,
      but extremely simple.
      For this purpose,
      prefix arithmetic is like a gift from the dakinis.
      It is almost trivial in concept,
      and almost impossible to get right when it is more than a few
      characters long.
      Two valid strings in this language are
      <q>say + 1 2</q>
      and
      <q>+++ 1 2 3 + + 1 2 4</q>.
      Their results are, in order, 3 and 13.
    </p><p>
      I restricted the calculator to addition, because even with one
      operator, prefix notation is more than confusing enough to serve our purposes.
      I have included an optional
      <tt>say</tt>
      keyword, in order
      to illustrate rejection of a token by type.
      In pure prefix arithmetic, either all tokens are valid or none are.
      The
      <tt>say</tt>
      keyword is only valid as the first token.
    </p><h3>The grammar</h3><p>
      The full code for this post is in
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/3974816">
        a Github gist</a>.
      It was run using
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-2.023_008">
        a release candidate for the full release of Marpa::R2</a>.
      Here is the grammar.
    </p><blockquote><pre><tt>
my $prefix_grammar = Marpa::R2::Grammar-&gt;new(
    {   start          =&gt; 'Script',
        actions        =&gt; 'My_Actions',
        default_action =&gt; 'do_arg0',
        rules          =&gt; [ &lt;&lt;'END_OF_RULES' ]
Script ::=
     Expression
   | kw_say Expression action =&gt; do_arg1
Expression ::=
     Number
   | op_add Expression Expression action =&gt; do_add
END_OF_RULES
    }
);
</tt></pre></blockquote>
    <p>The rules are specified in another DSL,
      of the kind I've used
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2012/dsl.html">
        in previous posts</a>.
      This one is incorporated in Marpa::R2 itself,
      and is
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-2.023_008/pod/BNF.pod">
        documented here</a>.
      Here are its features relevant to this example:
    </p><dl>
      <dt><strong><tt>::=</tt></strong></dt>
      <dd>A BNF rule in LHS
        <tt>::=</tt>
        RHS form</dd>
      <dt><strong><tt>|</tt></strong></dt>
      <dd>Separates alternative RHS's at the
        <strong>same</strong>
        precedence level</dd>
      <dt><strong><tt>=&gt;</tt></strong></dt>
      <dd><tt>keyword =&gt; value</tt>, where
        <tt>keyword</tt>
        is the name of an adverb.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The
      "<tt>action =&gt; do_add</tt>"
      adverb indicates that the semantics for the alternative
      are in the Perl closure named
      <tt>do_add</tt>.
    </p><p>The rest of the grammar's definition will be familiar to Marpa users.
      <tt>Script</tt>
      is the start symbol,
      the Perl closures implementing semantics are to be found in the
      <tt>My_Actions</tt>
      package,
      and where no semantics are explicitly specified,
      the Perl closure
      <tt>do_arg0</tt>
      is the default.
    </p><h3>The semantics</h3>
    <p>The semantics for this example are easy.
    </p><blockquote><pre><tt>
sub My_Actions::do_add  { shift; return $_[1] + $_[2] }
sub My_Actions::do_arg0 { shift; return shift; }
sub My_Actions::do_arg1 { shift; return $_[1]; }
</tt></pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      The first argument to a Marpa semantic closure is a "per-parse variable",
      which is not used in this application.
      The other arguments are the values of the child nodes,
      as determined recursively and in lexical order.
    </p><h3>The lexing table</h3>
    <p>
      In this post,
      I am skipping around in the code --
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/3974816">
        the full code is in the gist</a>.
      But lexical analysis is of particular interest to new
      Marpa users.
      The lexer I use for this example is overkill --
      table-driven and using Perl's progressive matching
      capabilities, it is capable of serving a much more
      complex language.
      (I talked about lexing more
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2012/dsl.html">
        in a previous example</a>.)
      Here is the lexing table:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
my @terminals = (
    [ Number =&gt; qr/\d+/xms,   'Number' ],
    [ op_add =&gt; qr/[+]/xms,   'Addition operator' ],
    [ kw_say =&gt; qr/say\b/xms, qq{"say" keyword} ],
);
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>The lexing table is an array of 3-element arrays.
      Each sub-array contains the symbol name, a regular expression
      that is used to recognize it, and a "long name",
      a human-readable name more appropriate for error messages
      than the symbol name.
      For some languages,
      the order of our lexing tables may be significant,
      although in the case of this language it makes no difference.
    </p>
    <h3>Types of parsing error</h3>
    <p>Before plunging into the error-handling code,
      I will describe the forms parsing errors take,
      and show the messages that the code this example
      DSL's error handling produces.
    </p>
    <h4>No valid token</h4>
    <p>The lexer may reach a point in the input
      where it does not find one of the allowed tokens.
      An example in this language would be an input with an
      an exclamation point.
      This is no need to talk much about this kind of error,
      which has always been relatively easy to diagnose,
      pinpoint and, usually, to fix.
    </p>
    <h4>The parser rejects a token</h4>
    <p>
      In some cases the lexer finds a token,
      but it is not one
      that the parser will accept at that point,
      so the parser rejects the token.
      An example for this language would be the input
      "<tt>+ 1 say 2</tt>", which causes the following diagnostic:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
Last expression successfully parsed was:  1
A problem occurred here:  say 2
Parser rejected token ""say" keyword"
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Marpa successfully determined that
      "<tt>1</tt>" is a valid expression of the language, but
      "<tt>+ 1</tt>" is not.
    </p>
    <h4>The parser becomes exhausted</h4>
    <p>
      In other cases, the parser may "dead end" -- reach a point
      where no more input can be accepted.
      One example is with the input
      "<tt>+ 1 2 3 + + 1 2 4</tt>".
      This causes the following diagnostic:
    </p><blockquote><pre>
Last expression successfully parsed was: + 1 2
The parse became exhausted here: " 3 + + 1 2 4"
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>The parser has completed a prefix expression.
      Unlike infix and postfix expressions, once a prefix
      expression has been
      allowed to end
      there is no way to "extend" or "restart" it.
      The parse is "exhausted".
    </p><p>A second example of an exhausted parse
      occurs with the the input
      "<tt>1 + 2 +3  4 + 5 + 6 + 7</tt>".
      Here is the diagnostic:
    </p><blockquote><pre>
Last expression successfully parsed was: 1
The parse became exhausted here: " + 2 +3  4 + 5 + 6 + 7"
</pre></blockquote>
    <h4>The input is fully accepted, but there is no parse</h4><p>
      Finally, it may happen that lexer and parser read and accept
      the entire input, but do not find a valid parse in it.
      For example, if the input is
      "<tt>+++</tt>", the diagnostic will be:
    </p><blockquote><pre>
No expression was successfully parsed
No parse was found, after reading the entire input
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>The input was a good start for a prefix expression,
      but no numbers were ever found,
      and our DSL reports that it never recognized any
      prefix expressions.
    </p><p>A more complicated case is this input:
      "<tt>++1 2++</tt>".
      Here is what our DSL tells us:
    </p><blockquote><pre>
Last expression successfully parsed was: +1 2
No parse was found, after reading the entire input
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      Our DSL did find a good expression, and tells us where it was.
      If there is more than one good expression, our DSL tells us
      the most recent.
      With input "<tt>++1 2++3 4++</tt>",
      the diagnostic becomes
    </p><blockquote><pre>
Last expression successfully parsed was: +3 4
No parse was found, after reading the entire input
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>In fact, if we thought it would be helpful
      our DSL could show all the expressions found,
      or the last
      <i>N</i>
      expressions for some
      <i>N</i>.
      This is a simple language with nothing but expressions
      involving a single operator.
      More interesting languages will have statements and blocks,
      and layers of subexpressions.
      The logic below can be straightforwardly modified to show us
      as much about these as we think will be helpful.
    </p><h3>Parsing the DSL</h3>
    <blockquote><pre>
sub my_parser {
    my ( $grammar, $string ) = @_;
    my @positions = (0);
    my $recce = Marpa::R2::Recognizer-&gt;new( { grammar =&gt; $grammar } );

    my $self = bless {
        grammar   =&gt; $grammar,
        input     =&gt; \$string,
        recce     =&gt; $recce,
        positions =&gt; \@positions
        },
        'My_Error';

    my $length = length $string;
    pos $string = $positions[-1];

    <big><b>... "Reading the tokens" goes here ...</b></big>

    my $value_ref = $recce-&gt;value;
    if ( not defined $value_ref ) {
        die $self-&gt;show_last_expression(), "\n",
            "No parse was found, after reading the entire input\n";
    }
    return ${$value_ref};
} ## end sub my_parser
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>The above closure takes a grammar and an input string, and either produces a parse
      value,
      or a diagnostic telling us exactly why it could not.
      For truly helpful diagnostics, I find it necessary to be able to quote
      the input exactly.
      The
      <tt>@positions</tt>
      array will be used to map the locations that the Marpa
      parser uses back to positions in the original input string.
      Marpa location 0 is always before any input symbol, so it is initialized
      to string position 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <tt>$self</tt>
      object is a convenience.
      It collects the information the error handler needs,
      and allows an elegant syntax for the error-handling calls.
    </p>
    <p>The loop for reading tokens will be described below.
      After it, but before the
      <tt>return</tt>,
      is our first error check.
      "No parse" errors show up after all the tokens have been read,
      when the
      <tt>$recce-&gt;value()</tt>
      call returns a Perl
      <tt>undef</tt>.
      In that case,
      we produce the message we showed above.
      The tricky details are hidden in the
      <tt>show_last_expression()</tt>
      method,
      which we will come to.
    </p><h3>Reading the tokens</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
TOKEN: while ( pos $string &lt; $length ) {
    next TOKEN if $string =~ m/\G\s+/gcxms;    # skip whitespace
    if ( $recce-&gt;exhausted() ) {
	die $self-&gt;show_last_expression(), "\n",
	    q{The parse became exhausted here: "},
	    $self-&gt;show_position( $positions[-1] ), qq{"\n},
	    ;
    } ## end if ( $recce-&gt;exhausted() )

    <big><b>...  "Looping through the lexing table" goes here ...</b></big>

    die 'A problem occurred here: ',
	$self-&gt;show_position( $positions[-1] ), "\n",
	q{No valid token was found};
} ## end TOKEN: while ( pos $string &lt; $length )

    <p>This loop implements part of our progressive matching
      within
      <tt>$string</tt>,
      and contains two of our four error checks.
      The
      <tt>exhausted()</tt>
      method check if the parse is
      exhausted,
      and again the hard work is done by the
      <tt>show_last_expression()</tt>
      method.
    </p><p>If we get through the lexing table without finding a token,
      we produce an invalid token message
      and report the position using the
      <tt>show_position()</tt>
      method.
      For invalid tokens, position should be all that
      the user needs to know.
      Position is also reported in the case of an exhausted parse.
      Implementation of the
      <tt>show_position()</tt>
      method presents
      no difficulties -- the code can be found in the gist.
    </p><h3>Looping through the lexing table</h3>
    <blockquote><pre>
TOKEN_TYPE: for my $t (@terminals) {
    my ( $token_name, $regex, $long_name ) = @{$t};
    next TOKEN_TYPE if not $string =~ m/\G($regex)/gcxms;
    if ( defined $recce-&gt;read( $token_name, $1 ) ) {
	my $latest_earley_set_ID = $recce-&gt;latest_earley_set();
	$positions[$latest_earley_set_ID] = pos $string;
	next TOKEN;
    }

	'A problem occurred here: ',
	$self-&gt;show_position( $positions[-1] ), "\n",
	qq{Parser rejected token "$long_name"\n};
} ## end TOKEN_TYPE: for my $t (@terminals)
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      Our innermost loop is through the lexing table,
      checking each table entry against the input string.
      If a match is found, the Marpa recognizer's
      <tt>read()</tt>
      method is called.
      This may fail due to our fourth and last type of error:
      a rejected token.
      Again,
      <tt>show_position()</tt>
      reports position
      and
      <tt>show_last_expression()</tt>
      does the interesting stuff.
    </p><h3>Showing the last expression</h3>
    <blockquote><pre><tt>
sub My_Error::show_last_expression {
    my ($self) = @_;
    my $last_expression =
        $self-&gt;input_slice( $self-&gt;last_completed_range('Expression') );
    return
        defined $last_expression
        ? "Last expression successfully parsed was: $last_expression"
        : 'No expression was successfully parsed';
} ## end sub My_Error::show_last_expression
</tt></pre></blockquote>
    <p>At its top level,
      <tt>show_last_expression()</tt>
      finds the parse locations of the last completed
      <tt>Expression</tt>
      symbol,
      using the
      <tt>last_completed_range()</tt>
      method.
      (In Marpa,
      as in other Earley parsers, a symbol or rule that has been recognized
      from start to finish is said to be "completed".)
      The parse locations are passed to the
      <tt>input_slice()</tt>
      method,
      which translates them into the corresponding substring of the input
      string.
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
sub My_Error::input_slice {
    my ( $self, $start, $end ) = @_;
    my $positions = $self-&gt;{positions};
    return if not defined $start;
    my $start_position = $positions-&gt;[$start];
    my $length         = $positions-&gt;[$end] - $start_position;
    return substr ${ $self-&gt;{input} }, $start_position, $length;
} ## end sub My_Error::input_slice
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Finding the last successful parse of a symbol</h3>
    <p>The
      <tt>last_completed_range()</tt>
      method does the
      complicated part of the error handling -- finding the last
      successfully recognized ("completed")
      occurrence of a symbol.
      The
      <tt>last_completed_range()</tt>
      method does not use
      any internals, but it certainly gets technical
      in its use of the external methods.
      It or something like it
      is a prime candidate to be folded into the Marpa
      interface someday.
    </p><p>
      Successful recognitions of a symbol are called,
      again following standard Earley parsing terminology,
      "completions".
      Completions are recorded by rule,
      so the first thing that must be done is to turn the
      symbol name into a list of those rules which have
      that symbol on their left hand side.
      These are called the
      <tt>@sought_rules</tt>.
      We also need to initialize the loop by
      recording the last parse location ("latest Earley set").
      <tt>$earley_set</tt>
      will be our loop variable.
    </p>
    <blockquote><pre>
sub My_Error::last_completed_range {
    my ( $self, $symbol_name ) = @_;
    my $grammar      = $self-&gt;{grammar};
    my $recce        = $self-&gt;{recce};
    my @sought_rules = ();
    for my $rule_id ( $grammar-&gt;rule_ids() ) {
        my ($lhs) = $grammar-&gt;rule($rule_id);
        push @sought_rules, $rule_id if $lhs eq $symbol_name;
    }
    die "Looking for completion of non-existent rule lhs: $symbol_name"
        if not scalar @sought_rules;
    my $latest_earley_set = $recce-&gt;latest_earley_set();
    my $earley_set        = $latest_earley_set;

    <big><b>... "Traversing the Earley sets" goes here ...</b></big>

    return if $earley_set &lt; 0;
    return ( $first_origin, $earley_set );
} ## end sub My_Error::last_completed_range
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      Once we have traversed the Earley sets, we need only return
      the appropriate value.
      If the Earley set number fell below 0, we never found any completions
      of the "sought rules",
      a circumstance which we report with a bare
      <tt>return</tt>
      statement.
      Otherwise,
      <tt>$first_origin</tt>
      and
      <tt>$earley_set</tt>
      will be set to the first and last parse locations of the completion,
      and we return them.
    </p>
    <h3>Traversing the Earley sets</h3>
    <p>This is our final code sample, and the buck stops here.
      Marpa::R2 introduced more detailed user access to the progress reporting
      information, and
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-2.023_008/pod/Progress.pod">
        that interface</a>
      is used here.
    </p>
    <p>We traverse the Earley sets in reverse order,
      beginning with the latest and going back, if necessary to Earley set 0.
      For each Earley sets, there are "progress items", reports of the progress
      as of that Earley set.
      Of these, we are only interested in completions,
      which have a "dot position" of -1.
      (Those interested in a fuller explanation of "dot positions",
      progress items, and
      progress reports, can look in
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-2.023_008/pod/Progress.pod">
        the documentation for progress reports</a>.)
      Of the completions, we are interested only in those for one of
      the
      <tt>@sought_rules</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For any given set of sought rules, more than one might end at
      an given Earley set.
      Usually we are most interested in the longest of these,
      and this logic assumes that we are only interested in the
      longest completion.
      We check if the start of the completion (its "origin") is prior to
      our current match, and if so its becomes our new
      <tt>$first_origin</tt>.
    </p>
    <p><tt>$first_origin</tt>
      was initialized to an non-existent Earley set,
      higher in number than any actual one.
      Once out of the loop through the progress items, we check if
      <tt>$first_origin</tt>
      is still at its initialized value.
      If so, we need to iterate backward one more Earley set.
      If not, we are done, and
      <tt>$first_origin</tt>
      and
      <tt>$earley_set</tt>
      contain the information that we were looking for -- the start and end
      locations of the most recent longest completion of one of the
      <tt>@sought_rules</tt>.
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
my $first_origin = $latest_earley_set + 1;
EARLEY_SET: while ( $earley_set &gt;= 0 ) {
    my $report_items = $recce-&gt;progress($earley_set);
    ITEM: for my $report_item ( @{$report_items} ) {
	my ( $rule_id, $dot_position, $origin ) = @{$report_item};
	next ITEM if $dot_position != -1;
	next ITEM if not scalar grep { $_ == $rule_id } @sought_rules;
	next ITEM if $origin &gt;= $first_origin;
	$first_origin = $origin;
    } ## end ITEM: for my $report_item ( @{$report_items} )
    last EARLEY_SET if $first_origin &lt;= $latest_earley_set;
    $earley_set--;
} ## end EARLEY_SET: while ( $earley_set &gt;= 0 )

      This post is part of
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/metapages/annotated.html#PARSE_HTML">
        a series</a>
      describing Marpa::R2::HTML,
      a configurable HTML parser.
      The last two posts described how to change
      the context and contents of the HTML
      elements, both new and existing.
      This post describes how to configure
      optional start tags: how to change 
      which start tags
      are optional,
      and how to specify the circumstances
      in which they will be supplied.
    </p>
    <h3>How the parser works</h3>
    <p>
      In the first posts in this series I went into some detail describing
      my Marpa-based approach to HTML parsing.
      Briefly, it combines a parse engine using a "wishful thinking" grammar
      with a Ruby Slippers lexer.
      The "wishful thinking" grammar expects all elements,
      without exception,
      to have both start and end tags.
      This overstrict grammar demands tags even in cases
      where the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-html40-19990824/sgml/dtd.html#inline">
        HTML 4.01 Strict DTD</a>
      mandates that they be treated as optional.
    </p>
    <p>
      The overstrict grammar is liberalized by the Ruby Slippers.
      Marpa has an unusual property among parsers -- it is fully
      informed about the state of the parse at all points,
      and can conveniently and efficiently share that information
      with the application.
      In Marpa::R2::HTML, when the parse engine, with its
      overstrict grammar, grinds to a halt for lack
      of a tag that does not exist
      in the physical input,
      the lexer can ask the parse engine which tag it is looking for.
      It can then dummy one up, feed it to the parse engine,
      and start things back up.
      It's as simple as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      For HTML end tags,
      the Ruby Slippers work stunningly well.
      Only one end tag will be expected at any point.
      In cases where a stack of elements must be properly terminated,
      the parse engine will request the end tags, one at a time,
      in proper order.
      The grammar can simplify life for itself by demanding a perfect
      world, and on the lexer's side, things are no harder -- it just
      has to do what it is told.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the very few start tags
      that are optional according to the Strict HTML 4.01 DTD,
      things are just as simple -- they occur in places where only one
      at a time will be demanded, and the Ruby Slippers lexer need
      only do what it is told to.
      However, if you want to further liberalize HTML, there will be
      cases where there is a choice between start tags;
      or between
      starting one element and ending another.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuring the Ruby Slippers</h3>
    <p>
      In the last post,
      I showed how to configure Marpa::R2::HTML to allow or disallow
      text directly in the
      <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>
      element.
      If Marpa::R2::HTML
      was configured to disallow 
      text directly in the
      <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>
      element,
      and it encountered such text,
      Marpa::R2::HTML would start a block.
      The block was started
      by supplying a
      <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>
      start tag in front of the text.
      In other words, Marpa::R2::HTML treated
      the
      <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>
      start tag as optional.
    </p>
      Let me give an example.
      Suppose the HTML document consisted of the string
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><tt>Hello, world</tt></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      and that, using the default configuration,
      we ran <tt>html_fmt</tt> as  follows:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><tt>echo 'Hello, world' |
/Users/jeffreykegler/perl5/bin/marpa_r2_html_fmt --no-added-tag-comment</tt></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This would be our result:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><tt>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Hello, world
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</tt></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This was produced using the default configuration,
      which resides in
      <a href="http://api.metacpan.org/source/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-2.022000/g/config/default.txt">
        the
        <tt>g/config/default.txt</tt>
        file</a>.
      (All the examples is this post use version 2.022000 of Marpa::R2.)
    </p>
    <h3>First, the results</h3>
    <p>
      Let's change the behavior of 
      Marpa::R2::HTML so that,
      instead of starting a new
      <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>
      element,
      it will reject the text as cruft.
      We create a new configuration,
      putting it into a file named
      <tt>g/config/reject_text.txt</tt>.
    <p>
      Creating the
      configuration will not be difficult,
      but it will perhaps be easiest to understand
      if we first see the result
      that we are aiming at.
      Again we run <tt>html_fmt</tt>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><tt>echo 'Hello, world' |
/Users/jeffreykegler/perl5/bin/marpa_r2_html_fmt \
  --compile reject_pcdata.txt  --no-added-tag-comment</tt></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And this is our new result:
    </p><blockquote><pre><tt>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;!-- html_fmt: Next line is cruft --&gt;
    Hello, world
&lt;/body&gt;
</tt></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Note that in this second example, there are no tags
      for the
      <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>
      element,
      and that the text is now labeled as "cruft", as desired.
    </p>
    <h3>How it was done</h3>
    <p>
      How would we change the default configuration file to refuse to start a new
      <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>
      element in front of text?
      The three relevant lines are:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><tt>@block_rubies  = &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;body&gt;
@inline_rubies = @block_rubies &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;p&gt;
PCDATA -&gt; @inline_rubies
</tt></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The symbols with an "<tt>@</tt>" sigil are lists,
      which the configuration file uses as a convenient shorthand for groups
      of symbols which occur frequently.
      For convenience in this discussion,
      let's expand them, so that relevant extract looks like this
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><tt>PCDATA -&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;p&gt;</tt></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the configuration file,
      <tt>PCDATA</tt>
      can be thought of as non-whitespace text,
      occurring in a context which is parsed
      for markup and entities.
      (Precisely, it is whatever
      HTML::Parser returns as text that is not whitespace
      and does not turn on the
      <tt>is_cdata</tt>
      flag.)
      What this line says is that, whenever
      a <tt>PCDATA</tt> token
      is rejected,
      Marpa::R2::HTML should try to fix the problem as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. If possible, start an
        <tt>&lt;html&gt;</tt>
        element.
      </li>
      <li>2. Otherwise, if possible, start a
        <tt>&lt;head&gt;</tt>
        element.
      </li>
      <li>3. Otherwise, if possible, start a
        <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>
        element.
      </li>
      <li>4. Otherwise, if possible, start a
        <tt>&lt;tbody&gt;</tt>
        element.
      </li>
      <li>5. Otherwise, if possible, start a
        <tt>&lt;tr&gt;</tt>
        element.
      </li>
      <li>6. Otherwise, if possible, start a
        <tt>&lt;td&gt;</tt>
        element.
      </li>
      <li>7. Otherwise, if possible, start a
        <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>
        element.
      </li>
      <li>8. Otherwise, if it is possible to end
        a non-structural or a 
        <tt>&lt;head&gt;</tt>
	element at this point, do so.
	(At any point, it will be possible to end
	at most one element.)
      </li>
      <li>9. Finally, if nothing else works, mark the "PCDATA" as cruft.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Of these alternatives, the first three allow Marpa::R2::HTML to supply missing
      structural start tags, as required by the standards.
      Alternatives 4, 5 and 6 allow Marpa::R2::HTML to continue building a table
      if table-building is in progress.
      (But note that the line does not allow Marpa::R2::HTML
      to deal with rejected
      PCDATA by starting a new table.)
      Alternative 7 allows Marpa::R2::HTML to start a new
      <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>
      element if PCDATA is rejected.
      <p>
      Alternatives 8 and 9 are implicit.
      By default, after all the explicit Ruby Slippers
      alternatives have been tried,
      Marpa::R2::HTML will create a Ruby Slippers tags
      for any end tag that is allowed,
      with two exceptions:
      Marpa::R2::HTML will not create
      <tt>&lt;/body&gt;</tt> and
      <tt>&lt;/html&gt;</tt> end tags except at the end of file.
      And Marpa::R2::HTML always reserves the possibility of,
      as a last resort,
      labeling a token as "cruft" and moving on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you understand how the Ruby Slippers configuration lines work,
      the fix in this case becomes obvious:
      In the expanded line,
      elminate the
      <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>
      as one of the alternatives considered for the Ruby Slippers.
      In terms of the expanded line,
      this means changing it to
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><tt>PCDATA -&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;</tt></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In terms of the original set of lines,
      this means changing the one for the
      <tt>@inline_rubies</tt>
      list:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><tt>@inline_rubies = @block_rubies &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;</tt></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the Ruby Slippers configuration lines of
      the default configuration file,
      the <tt>@inline_rubies</tt> list is the only place that
      the
      <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt> tag is mentioned.
      So changing
      <tt>@inline_rubies</tt>
      has effect
      of eliminating
      <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>
      as an optional start tag.
      Only <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt> tags actually in the physical
      input will be recognized.
      This is what was actually done
      in
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/3925571">
        <tt>g/config/reject_text.txt</tt>,
        the configuration file used in our example</a>.

      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2012/config_html.html">
        My last post</a>
      introduced Marpa::R2::HTML,
      a configurable HTML parser.
      By editing
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/3901637">
        a configuration file</a>,
      the user can change
      the variant of HTML
      being parsed.
      The changes allowed are very wide ranging.
      The previous post started with simple changes --
      the ability to specify the contents of new tags,
      and the context in which they can appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this post the changes get more aggressive.
      I change the contents of an existing HTML element --
      and not just any element, but
      one of the HTML's three "structural" elements.
      Marpa::R2::HTML allows the configuration file to change
      the contents of all pre-existing
      elements, with the exception of the highest level of the three
      structural elements:
      the
      <tt>&lt;html&gt;</tt>
      element itself.
    </p>
    <h3>Can text appear directly in an HTML body?</h3>
    <p>
      This post will discuss changing the contents of the
      <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>
      element.
      Fundamental to the HTML document as this element is,
      the definition of its contents has been very much in play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's start with the question posed in the title of this section:
      Can text appear directly in an HTML
      <tt>
        &lt;body&gt;</tt>
      element?
      That is, must text inside an HTML
      <tt>
        &lt;body&gt;</tt>
      be part of one of its child elements,
      or can it be directly part of the contents
      of the
      <tt>
        &lt;body&gt;</tt>
      element?
    </p><p>
      If you want an
      answer strictly according to the standards,
      then you get your choice in the matter.
      According to the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-html40-19990824/sgml/dtd.html#inline">
        HTML 4.01 Strict DTD</a>,
      the
      <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>
      contains a "block flow",
      which means that
      the answer is "No, text must be in the contents of a child element".
      Implementations of HTML were encouraged to be liberal, however,
      and in practice a lot of the HTML "out there"
      has text directly
      in
      <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>
      elements.
      Users expect their browsers to render these pages
      in the way that the writer intended them to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recognizing existing practice,
      HTML 5 changed to require conforming implementations to
      allow text to be interspersed with the block flow,
      in what I call a "mixed flow".
      A mixed flow can directly contain blocks and text,
      as well as inline elements.
      (The inline vs. block element distinction is basic to HTML parsing.
      See my earlier post or
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element">
        the well-organized Wikipedia page on HTML elements</a>.)
    </p>
    <h3>Block or mixed flow?</h3>
    <p>
      When parsing HTML, do you want to the treat contents of the body
      as a block flow or a mixed flow?
      Here are some of the factors.
    </p><ul>
      <li>
        Common practice requires accepting a mixed flow.
      </li><li>
        Cautious practice suggests writing a block flow.
      </li><li>
        HTML 4.01 requires block, but suggests being liberal.
      </li><li>
        HTML 5 requires that a mixed flow be accepted.
      </li><li>
        But HTML 5 also requires that the mixed flow be displayed as if it was written
        in blocks and
        suggests that explicit blocking be used to eliminate
        ambiguities.
      </li></ul>
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <h4>Body contains block flow</h4>
    <p>
      In this first example,
      the
      <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>
      contains a block flow.
      This is what is specified in
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/3901637">
        the default configuration file</a>.
      Here is the pertinent line:
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre><tt>
&lt;body&gt; is *block
</tt></pre></blockquote><p>
      This line says
      that the
      <tt>
        &lt;body&gt;</tt>
      element contains a block flow (<tt>*block</tt>).
      Here the star is a sigil which suggests the repetition operator
      of DTD's and regular expressions.
      (Readers of my last post will notice I've changed the configuration
      file syntax and will,
      I hope,
      find the new format an improvement.)
    </p><p>
      For the examples in this post,
      the HTML will be
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre><tt>
I cannot wait for a start tag&lt;p&gt;I can
</tt></pre></blockquote><p>
      We run this through the
      <tt>marpa_r2_html_fmt --no-added-tag-comment</tt>.
      Here is the output:
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre><tt>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I cannot wait for a start tag&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p>
      I can&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body>
&lt;/html&gt;
</tt></pre></blockquote><p>
      The first thing the parser encounters is text,
      which in this example is not allowed
      to occur directly in the body.
      As part of being a highly liberal HTML parser,
      however, Marpa::R2::HTML will supply a start tag
      in these situations.
      (This behavior, by the way, is also configurable --
      a change to the configuration file can
      tell Marpa::R2::HTML not to do this.)
      With its two
      <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>
      start tags,
      one of them conjured up by the Ruby Slippers,
      Marpa::R2::HTML breezes through its input.
    </p>
    <h4>Body contains mixed flow</h4>
    <p>
      In the second example, we liberalize the contents of
      the
      <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>
      to allow a mixed flow:
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre><tt>
&lt;body&gt; is *mixed
</tt></pre></blockquote><p>
      Here is the result:
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre><tt>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    I cannot wait for a start tag&lt;p&gt;
      I can&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</tt></pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      In a mixed flow, no
      second
      <tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt>
      start tag
      is needed, and none is created.
      Its matching end tag
      (<tt>&lt;/p&gt;</tt>) also does not
      have to be created.
      Otherwise, all is as before.
    </p>
    <h3>What I decided</h3>
    <p>
      Before I made my HTML parser configurable,
      I was forced to decide the issue of
      <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>
      contents one way or the other.
      My first
      implementation of the
      <tt>html_fmt</tt>
      utility was based on Marpa::XS
      and
      its grammar specified a mixed flow.
    </p><p>
      When I started a new version
      of the utility
      based on Marpa::R2,
      I reopened the issue.
      I decided that a stricter grammar produced a more precise parse,
      and that it was best to leave it up
      to the Ruby Slippers to "loosen things up"
      when the grammar was too strict.
      This was close, I hoped, to the best of both worlds,
      So I changed the grammar to specify a block
      flow for the contents of
      <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>
      element.
      This second choice -- strict block-flow-body grammar and liberal Ruby Slippers --
      remains the default in the configurable version.
    </p>
    <p>
      In current developer's releases of Marpa::R2,
      and in its next indexed release,
      both the grammar and the Ruby Slippers are configurable.
      The true best of both worlds happens when
      the user gets to decide.
    </p>
    <h3>Code and comments</h3>
    <p>
      The examples here were run using Marpa::R2 release 2.021_010.
      They are part of its test suite and can be found in the
      <tt>html/t/cfg_fmt.t</tt>
      file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The configurable Marpa::R2::HTML does considerably more than
      can be comfortably described in a single post.
      This post is the second of a series.

</center>
    <p>
      <!--
      marpa_r2_html_fmt --no-added-tag-comment
      -->
      This post introduces an HTML parser which is both liberal and configurable.
      Currently available as a
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-2.021_006">
        part of a Marpa::R2 developer's release on CPAN</a>,
      the new Marpa::R2::HTML allows detailed
      configuration of new tags
      and respecification of the behavior of existing tags.
    </p><p>
      To show how a configurable HTML parser works,
      I will start with a simple task.
      Let's suppose we have a new tag, call it
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>.
      The older, non-configurable version of Marpa, and most browsers,
      would recognize this tag.
      But they'd simply give it a default configuration,
      one which is usually very liberal --
      liberal meaning the tag is allowed to contain just about anything,
      and to go just about anywhere.
      A configurable parser allows us to specify the new tag's behavior
      more explicitly and strictly.
    </p><h3>
      Block vs. inline</h3><p>
      In this post
      I am going to assume that the reader knows,
      or will look up what he needs to know,
      about HTML.
      But block vs. inline is a essential HTML concept
      which is often ignored -- even
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">
      the excellent Wikipedia page on HTML</a>
      does not define "inline", although it uses the term in the technical
      sense twice.
      Since the concept is also central to this post,
      let me briefly summarize it.
    </p><p>
      Quoting from the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-html40-19990824/sgml/dtd.html#inline">
        HTML 4.01 Strict DTD</a>,
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
      HTML has two basic content models:

        %inline;     character level elements and text strings
        %block;      block-like elements e.g. paragraphs and lists
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      There is also what I will call a "mixed flow",
      which can contain anything that
      can appear in either a block or inline flow.
      (What I call a mixed flow is
      simply called a "flow"
      in the HTML 4.01 DTD.)
    </p><p>
      Significant in the examples are
      <code>
        &lt;p&gt;</code>,
      which is a block element that contains an inline flow and
      <code>
        &lt;span&gt;</code>,
      which is an inline element that contains an inline flow.
      The
      <code>
        &lt;body&gt;</code>
      tag is an important structural tag,
      which contains an block flow.
    </p><p>
      For simplicity I am following HTML 4.01 DTD.
      HTML 5
      uses radically different terminology and is more liberal
      in what it allows.
      Differences among standards are an important reason for
      an HTML parser to be configurable.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Controlling element context</h3>
    <h4>
      An inline element containing an inline flow</h4>
    <p>
      Let's define the
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      tag
      to be an inline tag with inline contents.
      This is done by adding the following line to the
      Marpa::R2::HTML grammar configuration file:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
ELE_acme is a FLO_inline included in GRP_inline
</pre></blockquote><p>
      Let's take as our HTML, the following:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;acme&gt;-during-&lt;span&gt;-more inline stuff-&lt;p&gt;-new block-
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      With the following shell commands,
      we add the new line to
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/3869482">
        <code>
          default.cfg</code>,
        the default grammar configuration file</a>.
      We then use the
      <code>
        marpa_r2_html_fmt</code>
      utility
      that comes with Marpa::R2
      to parse the HTML.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
cp default.cfg test.cfg
echo "ELE_acme is a FLO_inline included in GRP_inline" &gt;&gt; test.cfg
echo '&lt;acme&gt;-during-&lt;span&gt;-more inline stuff-&lt;p&gt;-new block-' |
  marpa_r2_html_fmt --no-added-tag --compile test.cfg
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>
<code>marpa_r2_html_fmt</code> indents the HTML and
      adds missing tags
This will show us the structure of our small HTML document.
      Here is what we get:
    </p>
    <!-- examples/acme-inline-inline.out -->
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;acme&gt;
        -during-&lt;span&gt;
          -more inline stuff-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/acme&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      -new block-
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      We see from this that the configuration took proper effect.
      Since the
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      tag was configured as an inline element,
      it cannot go directly inside the
      the
      <code>
        &lt;body&gt;</code>.
      So a new
      <code>
        &lt;p&gt;</code>
      is created to contain the
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      element.
      (A Marpa::R2::HTML configuration can also change
      the contents that are acceptable inside the
      <code>
        &lt;body&gt;</code>.
      For the moment, we'll keep it simple
      and accept as given that
      <code>
        &lt;body&gt;</code>
      contains a block flow.)
    </p><p>
      Similarly,
      since the
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      tag contains an inline flow,
      it must end before the next
      <code>
        &lt;p&gt;</code>
      tag.
      The parser supplies an
      end tag for the
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      element,
      and also
      closes the
      <code>
        &lt;p&gt;</code>
      paragraph that was
      started to hold the
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      element.
    </p>
    <h4>
      A block element containing an inline flow</h4>
    <!-- examples/acme-block-inline.out -->
    <p>
      Our new configuration line can also specify that
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      is a block element:
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
ELE_acme is a FLO_inline included in GRP_block
</pre></blockquote><p>
      The code to test this is very similar to that displayed above.
      It, and the scripts for all of this post's other examples,
      can be found
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/3870030">
        as a gist</a>.
      Here's the result:
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;acme&gt;
      -during-&lt;span&gt;
        -more inline stuff-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/acme&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      -new block-
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      Here the
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      element is allowed in a block,
      so no new
      <code>
        &lt;p&gt;</code>
      element was needed to contain it.
      Since
      the
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      element's contents are inline,
      the
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      element still needed to be ended before
      the
      <code>
        &lt;p&gt;</code>
      tag in the actual input.
    </p>
    <h3>
      The grammar configuration file</h3>
    <p>
      Those who click through to look at
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/3869482">
        the grammar configuration file</a>
      may notice
      its length.
      Three pages.
      And almost half of those three pages
      are single-line descriptions of elements
      which are one or more of deprecated, obsolete
      or proprietary.
      Arguably the configuration file
      should be even shorter.
    </p><p>
      Other implementations of liberal HTML
      parsers spread the logic specifying the HTML
      variant across a considerably larger body of code,
      sometimes a vastly larger.
      This very much affects the cost of evolving and
      maintain the parser.
    </p><p>
      As for the configuration file's format at the moment:
      it is experimental.
      I can state from experience that it is
      quite serviceable,
      and fairly readable,
      but it could be more elegant.
    </p><h3>
      Controlling element content</h3>
    <h4>
      A block element containing a mixed flow</h4>
    <!-- examples/acme-block-mixed.out -->
    <p>
      We can also configure the contents of
      the
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      element.
      This configuration line specifies a mixed flow.

      <pre>
ELE_acme is a FLO_mixed included in GRP_block
</pre></blockquote>
<p>And here is what we get:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;acme&gt;
      -during-&lt;span&gt;
        -more inline stuff-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        -new block-
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/acme&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      A mixed flow accepts any contents,
      so that the
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      element's contents expand to include the
      entire body of the html document.
    </p>
    <h4>
      A block element containing a block flow</h4>
    <!-- examples/acme-block-block.out -->
<p>With this configuration line, we request a block
        flow for the contents:
      </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
ELE_acme is a FLO_block included in GRP_block
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      The results:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;acme&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        -during-&lt;span&gt;
          -more inline stuff-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
        -new block-
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/acme&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      Here the
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      element also spans the entire body of the HTML
      element,
      but because block flows are less liberal than
      mixed flows,
      the contents of the
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      element have to be properly "packaged" inside
      block elements.
    </p>
    <h4>
      A block element containing PCDATA</h4>
    <!-- examples/acme-block-pcdata.out -->
    <p>
      We are getting progressively more restrictive with the contents
      of the
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      element.
      We've already seen the example
      of an
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      block element for inline contents.
      This configuration line specifies that the contents
      must be PCDATA.
      PCDATA allows text, but not child elements.
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
ELE_acme is a FLO_pcdata included in GRP_block
</pre></blockquote><p>
      The result:
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;acme&gt;
      -during-&lt;/acme&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;
        -more inline stuff-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      -new block-
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      Note here that the
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      tag ends as soon as another element is encountered.
    </p><h4>
      An empty block element</h4>
    <p>
      The final restriction on the
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      element is the insistance that it be empty:
      <!-- examples/acme-block-empty.out -->
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
ELE_acme is a FLO_empty included in GRP_block
</pre></blockquote>
      <p>
        And here is our result:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;acme&gt;
    &lt;/acme&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      -during-&lt;span&gt;
        -more inline stuff-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      -new block-
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
    <h3>
      Displayed effects</h3>
    <p>
      Any of these different configurations of
      the
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      tag could have a dramatic effect on what is displayed,
      depending on your CSS file.
      Whether or not
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      is a block element also affects
      what is displayed.
      When
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      is a block element,
      its boundaries will typically display as paragraph breaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the above examples,
      the case where
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      is configured as a block element containing PCDATA
      typically displays as three paragraphs:
    </p><pre>
-during-

-more inline stuff-

-new block-
</pre>
    <!-- html_fmt: Next line is cruft -->
    </p>
    <p>
      In the other cases, the end boundary of the
      <code>
        &lt;acme&gt;</code>
      element varies,
      but always coincides with the beginning or
      end of other block elements,
      so that the visible display is as
      two paragraphs:
    </p><pre>
-during- -more inline stuff-

-new block-
</pre>
    <!-- html_fmt: Next line is cruft -->
    </p>
    <h3>
      Final remarks</h3><p>
      The configurable Marpa::R2::HTML does considerably more than
      could be mentioned in this post.
      I hope to say more about it soon.

<p>This is Ocean of Awareness's
  new home.  This blog has been hosted at
  <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/">blogs.perl.org</a>
  but I have succumbed to the lure of static blogging.
  I have not yet decided how to deal with comments at this new blog location.
If the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
Also,
I will continue to dual-post for some time,
and have not yet frozen comments on the versions of the
