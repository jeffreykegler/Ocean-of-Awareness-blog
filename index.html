    <p>
      Marpa's SLIF (scanless interface) is a parser which
      allows an application to parse straight from a BNF grammar.
      Marpa parses vast classes of grammars in linear time,
      including all those classes currently in practical use.
      With its latest release, Marpa::R2's SLIF
      also allows application to mix their own custom lexing and parsing logic
      with Marpa's,
      and to switch back and forth between them.
      Among other things, this means that Marpa's SLIF can do procedural parsing.
    </p>
    <p>Modern programmers are accustomed to procedural parsing.
    And there are problems which are best tackled that way.
    Peter Stuifzand has used the just-released version of Marpa::R2 to
    tackle one of them: Perl-style here-documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marpa's latest version is
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2">Marpa::R2,
        which is available on CPAN</a>.
      Recently, it has gained immensely in "whipitupitude" with

</center>
  <p>
      <!--
      marpa_r2_html_fmt --no-added-tag-comment --no-ws-ok-after-start-tag
      -->
    </p>
    <p>In 1980, George Copeland wrote
      <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=802685">
    an article</a>
    titled "What if Mass Storage were Free?".
      Costs of mass storage were showing signs
      that they might fall dramatically.
      Copeland, as a thought exercise, took this trend to its extreme.
      Among other things, he predicted that deletion would become
      unnecessary, and in fact, undesirable.
    </p>
    <p>Copeland's
      thought experiment has proved prophetic.
      For many purposes, mass storage is treated as if it were free.
      For example, you probably retrieved this blog post from a server
      provided to me at no charge, in the hope
      that I might write and upload something interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until now languages were high-cost efforts.
      Worse, language projects ran a high risk of disappointment,
      up to and including total failure.
      I believe those days are coming to an end.
    </p>
    <h3>Small languages, shaped to the problem domain</h3>
    <p>What if whenever you needed a new language, poof, it was there?
      You would be encouraged to tackle each problem domain with
      a new language dedicated to dealing with that domain.
      Since each language is no larger than its problem domain,
      learning a language would be essentially the same as learning
      the problem domain.
      The incremental effort required to learn the language
      itself would head toward zero.
    </p>
    <h3>No more language bloat</h3>
    <p>Language bloat would end.
      Currently, the risk and cost of developing languages
      make it imperative to extend the ones we have.
      Free languages mean fewer reasons to add features
      to existing languages.
    </p>
    <h3>No more search for THE perfect language</h3>
    <p>
      No language is perfect for all tasks.
      But because the high cost of languages favors
      large, general-purpose languages,
      we are compelled to try for perfection anyway.
      Ironically, we are often making the language worse,
      and we know it.
    </p>
    <h3>A world full of perfect languages</h3>
    <p>An older sense of the word perfect is
      "having all the properties or qualities requisite to its nature and kind".
      The C language might be called perfect in this sense.
      C lacks a lot of features that are highly desirable in most contexts.
      But for programming that is portable
      and close to the hardware,
      the C language is perfect or close to it.
      If languages were free, this is the kind of perfection
      that we would seek --
      languages precisely fitted to their domain,
      so that adding to them cannot make them better.
    </p>
    <h3>Moving toward free</h3>
    <p>
      My own effort to contribute to 
      a fall in the cost of languages is the Marpa parser.
      Marpa produces a reasonable parser
      for every language you can write in BNF.
      If the BNF is for a grammar in any of the classes currently in practical
      use, the parser Marpa produces will have linear speed.
      In one case, using Marpa,
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/4447349">a targeted language</a>
      was written
      in less than an hour.
      <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/2013/01/a-language-for-writing-languages.html">
        More typically</a>, Marpa reduce the time needed to create new languages to hours.
    </p>
    <p>As one example of going from "impossible" to "easy",
      I have written a drop-in solution to an example in the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Gang
        of Four book</a>.
      The Gang of Four described a language
      and its interpretation,
      but they did not include a parser.
      Creating a parser
      to fit their example would have been
      impossibly hard when the Gang of Four wrote.
      Using Marpa, it is easy.
      The parser can be found in
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/03/bnf_to_ast.html">this
        earlier blog post</a>.
    </p>

<center><a name="interpreter"> <h2>The Interpreter Design Pattern</h2> </a>
</center>
  <p>
      <!--
      marpa_r2_html_fmt --no-added-tag-comment --no-ws-ok-after-start-tag
      -->
    </p>
    <p>The influential
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">
        <em>Design Patterns</em>
        book</a>
      lays out 23 patterns for programming.
      One of them, the Interpreter Pattern, is rarely used.
      Steve Yegge puts it a bit more strikingly -- he says
      that the book contains
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/ten-great-books">22
        patterns and a practical joke</a>.
    </p>
    <p>That sounds (and in fact is) negative, but
      <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/12/codes-worst-enemy.html">
        elsewhere</a>
      Yegge says that
      "[t]ragically, the only [Go4] pattern that can help code get smaller
      (Interpreter) is utterly ignored by programmers".
      (The
      <i>Design Patterns</i>
      book has four authors,
      and is often called the Gang of Four book, or Go4.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, under various names and definitions, the
      Interpreter Pattern and its close relatives and/or identical twins
      are widely cited,
      much argued and highly praised<a href="#NOTE1">[1]</a>.
          As they should be.
          Languages are the most powerful and flexible design pattern of all.
          A language can include all, and only, the concepts relevent
          to your domain.
          A language can allow you to relate them in all, and only, the appropriate ways.
          A language can identify errors with pinpoint precision,
          hide implementation details,
          allow invisible "drop-in" enhancements, etc., etc., etc.
        </p>
    <p>
      In fact languages are so powerful and flexible,
      that their use is pretty much universal.
      The choice is not whether or not to use a language to solve
      the problem,
      but whether to use
      a general-purpose language,
      or a domain-specific language.
      Put another way,
      if you decide not to use a language targeted
      to your domain,
      it almost always means that you
      are choosing to use another language that is not specifically
      fitted to your domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why then, is the Interpreter Pattern so little used?
      Why does Yegge call it a practical joke?
    </p>
    <h3>There's a problem</h3>
    <p>The problem with the Interpreter Pattern is that you must
      turn your language into an AST --
      that is,
      you must parse it somehow.
      Simplifying the language can help here.
      But if the point is to be simple at the expense of power
      and flexibility,
      you might as well
      stick with the other 22 design patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand,
      creating a parser for anything but the simplest languages
      has been a time-consuming effort,
      and one of a kind known for disappointing results.
      In fact,
      language development efforts run
      a real risk of total failure.
    </p>
    <p>How did the Go4 deal with this?
      They defined the problem away.
      They stated that the parsing issue was separate from the
      Interpreter Pattern, which was limited to what you did with the AST
      once you'd somehow come up with one.
    </p>
    <p>
      But AST's don't (so to speak) grow on trees.
      You have to get one from somewhere.
      In their example, the Go4 simply built an AST in their code,
      node by node.
      In doing this, they bypassed the BNF and the problem of parsing.
      But they also bypassed their language and the whole point
      of the Interpreter Pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which is why Yegge characterized the chapter as a practical joke.
      And why other programming techniques and patterns are almost
      always preferred to the Interpreter Pattern.
    </p>
    <h3>Finding that one missing piece</h3>
    <p>So that's how the Go4 left things.
      A potentially great programming technique,
      made almost useless because
      of a missing piece.
      There was no easy, general, and practical way to generate AST's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few expected that to change.
      I was more optimistic than most.
      In 2007 I embarked on a full-time project:
      to create a parser based on Earley's algorithm.
      I was sure that it would fulfill two of the criteria --
      it would be easy to use, and it would be general.
      As for practical -- well, a lot of parsing problems
      are small, and a lot of applications don't require a lot
      of speed, and for these I expected the result to be good enough.
    </p>
    <p>What I didn't realize was that
      all of the problems preventing
      Earley's from seeing real, practical use
      has already been solved in the academic literature.
      I was not alone in not having put the picture together.
      The people who had solved the problems
      had focused on two disjoint sets of issues,
      and were unaware of each other's
      work.
      In 1991, in the Netherlands,
      the mathematican Joop Leo had
      arrived at an astounding result --
      he showed how to make Earley's run in linear time for LR-regular grammars.
      LR-regular is a vast class of grammars.
      It easily includes, as a proper subset, every class of grammar now
      in practical use -- regular expressions, PEG, recursive descent,
      the LALR on which yacc and bison are based, you name it.
      (For those into the math,
      LR-regular includes LR(k)
      for all <i>k</i>,
      and therefore LL(k),
      also for all <i>k</i>.)
      </p>
      <p>
      Leo's mathematical approach did not address some nagging practical issues,
      foremost among them the handling of nullable rules and symbols.
      But ten years later in Canada,
      Aycock and Horspool focused on exactly these issues,
      and solved them.
      Aycock-Horspool
      seem to have been unaware of Leo's earlier result.
      The time complexity of the Aycock-Horspool
      algorithm was essentially that of
      Earley's original algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of Leo's work,
      for any grammar in any class currently in practical use,
      an Earley's parser could be fast.
      If only it could be combined with the approach
      of Aycock and Horspool, I realized,
      Leo's speeds could be available in an everyday programming tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      In changing the Earley parse engine,
      Aycock-Horspool and Leo had branched off in different directions.
      It was not obvious that their approaches could be combined, much less how.
      And in fact, the combination of the two is not a simple algorithm.
      But it is fast,
      and the new Marpa parse engine makes full information
      about the state of the parse (rules recognized, symbols expected, etc.)
      available as it proceeds.
      This is very convenient for, among other things, error reporting.
    </p>
    <h3>Eureka and all that</h3>
    <p>The result is an algorithm which parses anything
      you can write in BNF and
      does it in times considered optimal in practice.
      Unlike recursive descent, you don't have to write out the parser --
      Marpa generates a parser for you, from the BNF.
      It's the easy, "drop-in" solution that the Go4 needed and did not have.
      A reworking of the Go4 example, with the missing parser added,
      is in
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/03/bnf_to_ast.html">a

      <!--

      -->
      The latest version of
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2">
      Marpa</a> takes parsing "whipitupitude" one step further.
      You can now go straight from
      a BNF description of your language,
      and an input string,
      to an abstract syntax tree (AST).
    </p>
    <p>To illustrate, I'll use an example from the
      Gang of Four's (Go4's) chapter
      on the Interpreter pattern.
      (It's pages 243-255 of the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">
      <em>Design Patterns</em> book</a>.)
      The Go4 knew of no easy general way to go from BNF to AST,
      so they dealt with that part of the interpreter problem
      by punting --
      they did not even try to parse the input string.
      Instead they constructed the BNF they'd just presented and
      constructed an AST directly in their code.
    </p>
    <p>The reason the Go4 didn't know of an easy,
    generally-applicable way
      to parse their example was that
      there was none.
      Now there is.
      In this post, Marpa will take us
      quickly and easily
      from BNF to AST.
      (Full code for this post can
      be found in
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/jeffreykegler/5121769">a Github gist</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The Go4's example was a simple boolean expression language,
      whose primary input was
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
true and x or y and not x
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here, in full, is the BNF for an slight elaboration of the
      Go4 example.
      It is written in the DSL for Marpa's Scanless interface (SLIF DSL),
      and includes specifications for building the AST.
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
:default ::= action =&gt; ::array

:start ::= &lt;boolean expression&gt;
&lt;boolean expression&gt; ::=
       &lt;variable&gt; bless =&gt; variable
     | '1' bless =&gt; constant
     | '0' bless =&gt; constant
     | ('(') &lt;boolean expression&gt; (')') action =&gt; ::first bless =&gt; ::undef
    || ('not') &lt;boolean expression&gt; bless =&gt; not
    || &lt;boolean expression&gt; ('and') &lt;boolean expression&gt; bless =&gt; and
    || &lt;boolean expression&gt; ('or') &lt;boolean expression&gt; bless =&gt; or

&lt;variable&gt; ~ [[:alpha:]] &lt;zero or more word characters&gt;
&lt;zero or more word characters&gt; ~ [\w]*

:discard ~ whitespace
whitespace ~ [\s]+
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This syntax should be fairly transparent.
      In previous posts I've given
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/01/dsl_simpler2.html">
        a tutorial</a>,
      and a
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/01/announce_scanless.html">a
        mini-tutorial</a>.
      And of course, the interface is
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-2.048000/pod/Scanless/DSL.pod">
        documented</a>.
    </p>
    <p>For those skimming, here are a few quick comments on less-obvious features.
      To guide Marpa in building the AST,
      the BNF statements have
      <tt>action</tt>
      and
      <tt>bless</tt>
      adverbs.
      The
      <tt>bless</tt>
      adverbs indicate a Perl class into which the node should be
      blessed.
      This is convenient for using an object-oriented approach with the AST.
      The
      <tt>action</tt>
      adverb tells Marpa how to build the nodes.
      "<tt>action =&gt; ::array</tt>" means the result of the rule should
      be an array containing its child nodes.
      "<tt>action =&gt; ::first</tt>" means the result of the rule should just be
      its first child.
      Many of the child symbols,
      especially literal strings of a structural nature,
      are in parentheses.
      This makes them invisible to
      the semantics.
    </p>
    <p>A
      <tt>:default</tt>
      pseudo-rule specifies the defaults -- in this case the
      "<tt>action =&gt; ::array</tt>" adverb setting.
      The
      <tt>:start</tt>
      pseudo-rule specified the start symbol.
      The <tt>:discard</tt> pseudo-rule
      indicates that whitespace is to be discarded.
    </p>
    <p>The Go4 did not deal with precedence.
      In their example, the input string is fully parenthesized,
      even though its priorities are the standard ones.
      I've eliminated the parentheses, because
      the standard precedence is implemented in SLIF grammar.
      The double vertical bar ("<tt>||</tt>") is a "loosen" operator --
      an alternative after "loosen" operator will be
      at a looser precedence than the one before.
      Alternatives separated by a single bar are at the same precedence.
    </p><h3>Creating the AST</h3><p>
      Creating the AST is simple.
      First, we use Marpa to turn the above DSL for boolean expressions
      into a parser.
      (We'd saved the SLIF DSL source in the string
      <tt>$rules</tt>.)
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
my $grammar = Marpa::R2::Scanless::G->new(
    {   bless_package => 'Boolean_Expression',
        source        => \$rules,
    }   
);  
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Next we define a closure that uses
      <tt>$grammar</tt>
      to turn
      BNF into AST's.
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
sub bnf_to_ast {
    my ($bnf) = @_;
    my $recce = Marpa::R2::Scanless::R->new( { grammar => $grammar } );
    $recce->read( \$bnf );
    my $value_ref = $recce->value();
    if ( not defined $value_ref ) {
        die "No parse for $bnf";
    }
    return ${$value_ref};
} ## end sub bnf_to_ast
</pre>
    </blockquote><p>
Where <tt>$bnf</tt> is our input string,
we run it as follows:
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
my $ast1 = bnf_to_ast($bnf);
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>The AST</h3>
    <p>If we use Data::Dumper to examine the AST,
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
say Data::Dumper::Dumper($ast1) if $verbose_flag;
</pre>
    </blockquote><p>
      we see this:
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
$VAR1 = bless( [
                 bless( [
                          bless( [
                                   'true'
                                 ], 'Boolean_Expression::variable' ),
                          bless( [
                                   'x'
                                 ], 'Boolean_Expression::variable' )
                        ], 'Boolean_Expression::and' ),
                 bless( [
                          bless( [
                                   'y'
                                 ], 'Boolean_Expression::variable' ),
                          bless( [
                                   bless( [
                                            'x'
                                          ], 'Boolean_Expression::variable' )
                                 ], 'Boolean_Expression::not' )
                        ], 'Boolean_Expression::and' )
               ], 'Boolean_Expression::or' );
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Processing the AST</h3>
    <p>In their example,
    the Go4 processed their AST in several ways:
    straight evaluation, copying,
      and substitution of the occurrences of a variable in one boolean expression
      by another boolean expression.
      It is obvious that the AST above is the computational
      equivalent of the Go4's AST,
      but for the sake of completeness I carry out the same operations
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/jeffreykegler/5121769">in the Github gist</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      AST creation via Marpa's SLIF is self-hosting --
      the SLIF DSL is parsed into an AST,
      and a parser created by interpreting the AST.
      The Marpa SLIF DSL source file in this post,
      that describes boolean expressions,
      was itself turned into an AST on its way to becoming a parser
      that turns boolean expressions into AST's.

      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/01/announce_scanless.html">
      Scanless interface</a>
      is not yet two weeks old,
      but already there are completed applications.
      Significantly, two of them are for work.
      <h3>A JSON Parser</h3>
      <p>The non-work-related application is
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/4447349">
      a JSON parser</a>.
      Given what it does,
      it easily could have been work-related.
      (It's been available for a few days as a gist,
      so it may well be in production use somewhere.)
      It was written by Peter Stuifzand,
      runs 185 lines
      and took him less than 30 minutes to write.
      Peter reports that it was a matter of
      typing in the grammar,
      and adding a few Perl functions to provide the semantics.
      <p>
      There are, of course, other JSON parsers out there,
      many of which run faster.
      These, however, took weeks to write.
      If you are, for example,
      thinking of
      <a href="http://bolinfest.com/essays/json.html">
      extending JSON</a>,
      and development time is a major consideration,
      the Marpa-based solution will be attractive.
      <h3>Printer escape codes</h3>
      Peter also did
      <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/marpa-parser/n4ouLW0e6P8/vdrku9fczZEJ">
      a Marpa-based language for work</a> --
      a solution to the problem of printer escape codes.
      For those unfamilar, a printer's special features can often be invoked
      by "escape sequences" --
      byte sequences which control things like cursor motion, color, character sets,
      graphics, etc., etc.
      It's nice to invoke them with a set of well-named functions.
      <p>Escape sequences are usually repetitive,
      and when complex, are usually not complex in an interesting way.
      They can be programmed with regex or eval hacks.
      But this time
      Peter chose to write 
      a mini-language that specifies 
      escape sequences,
      and to use Marpa to
      compile the mini-language into Perl code.
      He was done in a hour.
      <h3>A log file query language</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, an interesting and adventurous language effort
      was underway on
      the other side of the Atlantic, where Paul Bennett,
      faced with analyzing lots of nginx log files,
      <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/110360907592575381901/posts/XdTPRHvbA8w#110360907592575381901/posts/XdTPRHvbA8w">
      decided a powerful custom log query language was
      the best way to address his issue</a>.
      Paul needed to design and specify his language from scratch.
      Paul was also facing a learning curve,
      but he read the gist for a Scanless interface example,
      and apparently was able to teach himself quickly from there.
      (He doesn't say, but it might have been the one for
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/01/dsl_simpler2.html">
      this post</a>.)
      <p>Like Peter's escape sequence language,
      Paul's log query language program compiles to Perl.
      Its writing and debugging
      were spread out over 3 days.
      Paul reports that his language is on the job already,
      but that
      it needs some clean-up before going onto CPAN.
      <p>
      The snippets Paul shows are enticing.
      The language seems to include 
      strings, integers and timestamps as supported types;
      regexes;
      a full set of comparison and boolean operators;
      and helpful new "any", "between" and "one" operators.
      Pretty good for three days.
      A lot of nasty problems snuggled away
      in log files may find their
      hiding places are not nearly as safe 
      as they have been able to expect.
