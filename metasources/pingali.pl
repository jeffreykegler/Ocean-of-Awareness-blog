    <h2>Parsing with derivatives</h2>
    <p>In a very cordial Twitter exchange with Matt Might and
    and David Darais, Prof. Might asked why I was not looking at his
    derivatives-based approach.
    I answered that I was --
    I see
    Marpa as an optimized version of the Might/Darais approach.
    </p>
    <p>This may sound strange.
    At first glance, the two algorithms seem about as different as
    two algorithms that address the same problem space can
    get.
    My Marpa parser is an Earley parser, table-driven
    with its core logic implemented in C language.
    The Might/Darais/Spiewak parser is an extension of regular expressions
    which constructs states on the fly,
    and which deals that approaches speed issues by using memoization
    and lazy evaluation and fixed points.

    <p>The key to seeing the common ground is a paper sent
    me by Prof. Pingali at Austin.
