Why is parsing considered solved? II

    In a previous post I asked "Why is parsing considered solved?"
    If the state of the art is to be believed, then the human brain has a
    mysterious power that makes it much better at parsing than computers.
    Once it was taken seriously that humans might have the power to, for
    example, "read" a chessboard in a way that computers could not beat.
    This kind of "computational mysticism" has taken a beating, but
    survives in one last stronghold -- parsing theory.
    </p>

    Previously I answered this question.  I explained why practitioners
    came to believe they'd reached the limit in 1965: Every practical
    parser was stack-driven

      I encourage
      those who want to know more about the story of Parsing Theory
      to look at my
      <a href="https://jeffreykegler.github.io/personal/timeline_v3">
        Parsing: a timeline 3.0</a>.
      In particular,
      "Timeline 3.0" tells the story of the search for a good
      LR(k) subclass,
      and what happened afterwards.

      my Earley/Leo-based parsing project,
      there is the

      The official, but more limited, Marpa website
