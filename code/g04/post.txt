This sounds pretty complicated
and you may be saying this something, "this would be a crazy
way to add two numbers."
But, in fact, for most of us most of the time,
the Interpreter Pattern is <b>exactly</b>
the way we add two numbers,
and this includes not most of those modern situations
where efficiency is the priority.
In C language for example, "x+2" is parsed into an AST
and converted to machine instructions which are eventually
run to produce the answer.

you fit your problem into a pre-determined general-purpose language.
With the Interpreter Pattern you create a language targeted at your
problem.
