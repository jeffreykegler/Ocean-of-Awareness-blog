those who view mathematical science, not merely as a vast body of
abstract and immutable truths, whose intrinsic beauty, symmetry and
logical completeness, when regarded in their connexion together as
a whole, entitle them to a prominent place in the interest of all
profound and logical minds, but as possessing a yet deeper interest
for the human race, when it is remembered that this science constitutes
the language through which alone we can adequately express the great
facts of the natural world, and those unceasing changes of mutual
relationship which, visibly or invisibly, consciously or unconsciously
to our immediate physical perceptions, are interminably going on
in the agencies of the creation we live amidst: those who thus think
on mathematical truth as the instrument through which the weak mind
of man can most effectually read his Creator's works, will regard
with especial interest all that can tend to facilitate the translation
of its principles into explicit practical forms.
