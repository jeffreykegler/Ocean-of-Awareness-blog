<p>Creating your own languages has been A Big Deal(tm).
What if you could create a simple language in hours or minutes?
But there has been a serious obstacle to this up to now.
No practical parser "just parsed" BNF.
With Marpa, that restriction is lifted.
<p>
In this post, I will describe
a small, sample Marpa domain-specific language (DSL).
In designing it I am inspired by Mark Dominus's
description of the
"Worse is Better" philosophy,
and Blosxom's implementation of it.
This DSL is kept very simple.
The intent is that the reader will build
on it.
Having features is not so important as
allowing the user to see how features can be
added.
<h3>A calculator</h3>
This DSL is a calculator.
Calculators make familiar example,
and, after all, any tool you build this
DSL will probably find it useful to allow the
user to arithmetic.<br /><br />posted at: 21:16 | path: <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog"></a> | <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/2012/08/24#dsl">permanent link to this entry</a></p>
