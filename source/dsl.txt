<h2>Domain-Specific Languages made simple</h2>
<h3>Writing your own language</h3>
<p>Creating your own languages has been A Big Deal(tm).
What if you could create a simple language in hours or minutes?
But there has been a serious obstacle to this up to now.
No practical parser "just parsed" BNF.
With Marpa, that restriction is lifted.
<p>
In this post, I will describe
a small, sample Marpa domain-specific language (DSL).
In designing it I am inspired by Mark Dominus's
description of the
"Worse is Better" philosophy,
and Blosxom's implementation of it.
This DSL is kept very simple.
The intent is that the reader will build
on it.
<h3>A calculator</h3>
This DSL is a calculator.
Calculators are a familiar example.
And, after all, whatever tool you build this
DSL into, it will probably be useful
to have a calculator as part of it.
