An HTML Pretty-printer
    <p>
      It's nice to get a big project to the point where it produces
      something which is actually useful.
      I'm pleased to announce
      <tt>

        html_fmt</tt>,
      an HTML pretty printer
      that's part of the
      <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">
        Marpa::HTML</a>
      distribution.
    </p>
    <!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one -->
    <p>
      The command
    </p>

    <!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one -->
    <pre>
    html_fmt http://perl.org

</pre>
   <p>will pretty-print
    the HTML for
    <tt>
      http:://perl.org</tt>.
    Tags are printed out one per line, indented according to structure.
    <tt>
      html_fmt
    </tt>

    supplies any missing start or end tags,
    adding comments to that effect.
    <tt>
      html_fmt
    </tt>
    respects &lt;pre&gt; tags.
    <p>
      If the argument is not a URI, it's interpreted as a file name.
      Suppose, for example, that
      <tt>
        very_bad_html
      </tt>

      is a file
      containing this HTML: "<tt>&lt;tr&gt;cell data</tt>".
      Then
      <tt>
        html_fmt very_bad_html
      </tt>
      will convert it into this:
    </p>
    <!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one -->
    <pre>
    &lt;!-- Following start tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;!-- Following start tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
      &lt;!-- Following start tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;!-- Following start tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
          &lt;!-- Following start tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
          &lt;tbody&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
              &lt;!-- Following start tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
              &lt;td&gt;
                cell data
              &lt;/td&gt;
              &lt;!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
          &lt;/tbody&gt;
          &lt;!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
        &lt;!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
    &lt;!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one --&gt;

</pre>
    <p>
      <tt>
        html_fmt
      </tt>
      seeks to be as liberal as any HTML rendering
      engine you'll ever encounter.
      It treats
      <strong>

        all
      </strong>
      files as HTML.
      Occasionally even
      <tt>
        html_fmt</tt>'s
      aggressive liberalizations of the syntax cannot make a document parse as HTML.
      When that happens,
      <tt>
        html_fmt
      </tt>
      tags unparseable sections of the document as "cruft".
      Cruft is included in the output,
      but is ignored for the purpose of determining the document's structure.
      An identifying comment is added after the cruft.

    <!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one -->

    <p>
      <tt>html_fmt</tt> was intended to allow easy reading of HTML,
      and as a diagnostic tool.
      It was not originally intended for reformatting.
      But the prettified output of
      <tt>
        html_fmt
      </tt>
      will usually render the same as the input,
      modulo some extra spacing, particularly around end tags.
      This blog post, for example,
      was run through
      an
      <tt>
        html_fmt
      </tt>
      command.
      A future release may reduce or eliminate spacing changes.

      uses
      <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Mechanize/">
        WWW::Mechanize</a>
      to fetch URI's
      and
      <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTML-Parser/">

        HTML::Parser</a>
      to do the low-level HTML parsing.
      The high-level structure of the HTML is determined by
      <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">
        Marpa::HTML</a><!--
      -->.

    <!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one -->

      I developed
      <tt>

        html_fmt
      </tt>
      as a test of
      <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">
        Marpa<!--
      --></a><!--
      -->.
      What are the advantages of using Marpa?
      Other high-level
      HTML/XHTML/XML parsers use regular expressions
      and/or ad-hoc methods.
      In some implementations these are fast,
      but they are not easy to maintain.
      <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">
        Marpa</a>
      is a general BNF parser generator,
      and
      <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">
        Marpa::HTML<!--
      --></a>

      is based on a BNF representation of a liberalized HTML.
      That makes it easy enough to change if you prefer a
      different liberalization of the XHTML/HTML standards.
    </p>
    <!-- Preceding end tag is replacement for a missing one -->
    <p>
      A few additional parsing tricks are added for efficiency.
      These also are intuitive and are driven by tables
      that are straightforward to modify.
      In future blog posts I hope to explain in detail how
      <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa-HTML/">
        Marpa::HTML</a>
      parses HTML.

    <p>
      <tt>
        html_fmt</tt>'s
      current speed is quite acceptable for looking at individual web pages.
      Right now
      <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Marpa/">
        Marpa</a>
      is only in a "Pure Perl" implementation.
      More could be desired by users who need to crunch a large database of HTML.
      I've started on the XS version, and when that is complete I expect speeds,
      not equal to those of rendering engines custom-coded in C,
      but in the same ballpark.
