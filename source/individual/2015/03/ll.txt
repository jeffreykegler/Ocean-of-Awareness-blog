    <h3>ambiguity Hoffa and precision</h3>
    <p>PEG parsing has been called "precise",
    because PEG parsing is in a sense unambiguous.
    In this case "precise" is taken as synonymous with
    "unique".
    That is, PEG parsing is precise in exactly the same
    sense as the location of Jimmy Hoffa's body
    is a precise location.
    We know there is exactly one such place, but
    without necessarily being able to specify it.
    </p>
    <p>For those not yet in the know on this,
    I'll explain with a pair of examples from
    <a href="http://www.romanredz.se/papers/FI2008.pdf">
    an excellent 2008 paper by Redziejowski</a>.
    Let's start with these two PEG grammars.
    <blockquote><pre>
    ("a"|"aa")"a"
    ("aa"|"a")"a"
    </pre></blockquote>
    One of these two PEG grammars accepts
    the string "<tt>aaa</tt>" and "<tt>aa</tt>".
    The other accepts the string
    the string "<tt>aa</tt>" and "<tt>aaa</tt>".
    Can you tell which one?
    Could you sort this out
    if this logic was buried in a large specification?
    (For the answer to the first question,
    see page 4 of
    <a href="http://www.romanredz.se/papers/FI2008.pdf">
    Redziejowski 2008</a>.
    <p>
    Here is another example:
    <blockquote><pre>
    A = "a"A"a"/"aa"
    </pre></blockquote>
    What language does this describe?
    It's obviously string of the letter "<tt>a</tt>",
    but which ones?
    Again the answer is on
    page 4 of
    <a href="http://www.romanredz.se/papers/FI2008.pdf">
    Redziejowski 2008</a> -- it's exactly those strings
    whose length is a power of 2.
