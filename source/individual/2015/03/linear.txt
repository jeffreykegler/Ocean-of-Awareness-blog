Linear for all those grammars?  I don't believe it

    <h3>Linear?</h3>
    <p>I repeatedly stated that my new parser, Marpa,
    is linear for vast classes of grammars,
    going well beyond
    But there are skeptics out there,
    and in this case skepticism is justified.
    When it comes to parsing algorithms,
    you see a lot of time complexity claims
    that are hand-wavy, misleading or just
    plain false.
    <p>
    Marpa's linearity claims are,
    by the standards of traditional parsers,
    very bold.
    Marpa claims linearity
    for every grammar that
    yacc/bison, PEG and recursive descent claim,
    and then some.
    yacc is linear for LALR, which is a subset of LR(1).
    If you use GLR, bison claims linearity for LR(1).
    As used in practice,
    recursive descent is LL(k), where k is 1 or maybe
    a bit larger.
    With packratting,
    PEG can be made linear for everything it
    parses but only in limited cases do you know
    what language your PEG grammar actually parses.
    PEG researchers are trying to extend this,
    but, in current practice, that means your PEG grammar
    must be LL(1).
    <p>
    Marpa claims to be linear for LR-regular grammars,
    which include the LR(k) grammars for every k.
    LR-regular includes LL-regular,
    and, for every k, LR(k) includes LL(k),
    which means that every class of grammar under discussion
    in the PEG literature is
    already parsed in linear time by Marpa.
