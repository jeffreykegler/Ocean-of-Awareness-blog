Which Marpa distribution to use?
<p>
Which distribution of Marpa should you use?
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>
or
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-PP">Marpa::PP</a>
or the "bare name" Marpa?
Use
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>
if you can,
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-PP">Marpa::PP</a>
otherwise.
The "bare name" Marpa is a legacy distribution,
and should be avoided by new users
and in new implementations.
<h2>Marpa::XS</h2>
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>

incorporates all of my C language speedups.
As well as the fastest of the Marpa distributions,
it is also the only one in beta --
in particular, I will be at pains to keep the interface stable.
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>
is best both for the casually curious,
and for those intending to use
the Marpa algorithm in their applications.
Note that since
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>
remains beta, caution is still advised.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a> DOES require a C compiler,
as well as
<a href="#GNU_LIBS">glib</a>
and a few other GNU prerequisites.
To run and install
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>

and its documentation, you DO NOT
need
<a href="#POSIX">POSIX</a>,
<a href="#GNU_LIBS">glibc</a>,
<a href="#GCC">gcc</a> or
<a href="#TEX">TeX</a>.
</p>
<h2>Marpa::PP</h2>
<p>
If you can't install
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>,
the other choice is

<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-PP">Marpa::PP</a>.
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-PP">Marpa::PP</a>
is Pure Perl;
it has most of the features of
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>;
and it has fewer prerequisities.
But
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-PP">Marpa::PP</a>
remains in alpha;
it is 5 times slower than
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>;
and it will have a lower priority for bug fixes.
</p>
<h2>"Bare name" Marpa</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa">

The "bare name" Marpa distribution is a legacy</a>.
If you are new to Marpa, please do not use it.
I leave it on CPAN only as a service to Marpa's past users.
If I could remove it without impacting them, I would.
</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ol>
<li><a name="POSIX">"POSIX"</a>:
In theory,
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>
runs on Windows.
I say "in theory"
because while all of
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>'s
prerequisites run on Windows,
to my knowledge nobody has ever assembled them
and actually run Marpa::XS on Windows.
I am not "anti-Microsoft", but
I do not at this moment
have access to a Windows machine.
</li>
<p><li><a name="GNU_LIBS">"glib and glibc"</a>:
It's easy to confuse
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLib">glib</a>
and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glibc">glibc</a>.
Both are GNU libraries.
glibc is GNU's C standard library,
which implements parts of
POSIX and requires others.
Marpa::XS
does NOT require glibc or POSIX.
</p>
<p>
glib, on the other hand,
is GNU's cross-platform software utility library.
Marpa::XS DOES require glib.
glib does NOT require UNIX, POSIX, or glibc.
glib is not tiny, but the alternative to
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>'s
use of glib would be my attempt at a portable reimplementation
of those parts of it that
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>
uses.
For the moment, glib is the safest and easiest way to go.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><a name="GCC">"gcc"</a>:
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>'s
C code consists of its core library (libmarpa) and an XS wrapper.
The XS wrapper compiles with any compiler which compiles Perl.
libmarpa compiles clean with the <kbd>-ansi</kbd>
and <kbd>-pedantic</kbd> flags
and therefore any C89 compiler should work.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><a name="TEX">"TeX"</a>:
If you poke into the subdirectories,
you may be alarmed to see places where TeX and/or CWeb is used.
No TeX or CWeb is required to install or run
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>
or its documentation.
They are for DEVELOPMENT ONLY.
In fact, if you plan on hacking the Perl interface code,
or even the XS wrapper, you still don't need to have
TeX and CWeb on your system.
It is only the highly mathematical core of Marpa,
libmarpa, that uses CWeb and therefore TeX.
If you look at
<a href="https://github.com/downloads/jeffreykegler/Marpa--R2/marpa.pdf">

the libmarpa code</a>,
I think you'll see that,
when it came to documenting libmarpa,
POD, C comments, and man pages were simply not going
to be enough to do the job.
