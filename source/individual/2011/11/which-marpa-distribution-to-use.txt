Which Marpa distribution to use?
<p>
Which distribution of Marpa should you use?
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>
or
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-PP">Marpa::PP</a>
or the "bare name" Marpa?
Use
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>
if you can,
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-PP">Marpa::PP</a>
otherwise.
The "bare name" Marpa is a legacy distribution,
and should be avoided by new users
and in new implementations.
<h2>Marpa::XS</h2>
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>

incorporates all of my C language speedups.
As well as the fastest of the Marpa distributions,
it is also the only one in beta --
in particular, I will be at pains to keep the interface stable.
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>
is best both for the casually curious,
and for those intending to use
the Marpa algorithm in their applications.
Note that since
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-XS">Marpa::XS</a>
remains beta, caution is still advised.
