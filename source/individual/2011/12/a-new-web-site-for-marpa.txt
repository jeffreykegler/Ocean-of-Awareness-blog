A new web site for Marpa
<p>
I have created an
<a href="http://www.jeffreykegler.com/marpa">official web site
for Marpa</a>.
Marpa is attracting new users,
to the point where I thought it might be useful to have a site to act as
a central directory.
The official web site won't have much in the way of new content.
With new content,
I plan to continue to do
what I've been doing -- post it to this blog.
</p>
<p>
I've started the site with an annotated list of the
most important Marpa-related posts in this blog.
I hope this will help people newly interested in
Marpa figure out where they want to start.
Those who've been following this blog for a while
might also want to check the list to see if they've
missed anything worthwhile.
