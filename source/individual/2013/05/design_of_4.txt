The Design of Four

      In the Perl world at the moment,
      a lot is being said about the consequences of bad design.
      A lot should be said.
      A lot needs to be said.
      But this post will not say those things.
    </p>
    <p>
      As useful as it is to study design failures,
      the exercise will come to nothing unless you
      also find some road to learning good design.
      This post will point out four
      Perl-centric
      projects which I believe must be accounted,
      not just successful,
      but so successful they are worth study as models.
    </p>
    <p>
      The projects are
      ack,
      cpanm,
      local::lib and
      perlbrew.
      Each of these is perfect
      in the older sense of "having all that is requisite to its nature and kind"
      (<a href="http://1828.mshaffer.com/d/word/perfect">
        Webster's 1828</a>).
      To really appreciate their perfection, you need to be a potential user,
      and that's the best way to learn about their design.
    </p>
    <p>ack is a file search tool -- UNIX's grep with improvements.
      The improvements are influenced by a Perl sensibility,
      and ack is written in Perl.
      But while the other tools I list will be of little interest fi
      you don't speak Perl,
      ack is something that will benefit someone who otherwise shuns Perl tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      cpanm is for installing CPAN packages from CPAN.
      If you don't know what that means, you aren't interested.
      If you do, you want to be using it.
      It does everything you need and importantly, nothing more.
      The interface is without clutter.
      Like I said, perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      local::lib is for installing Perl modules in the directory of your choice.
      Even if you have root permission on a system,
      it is good practice to leave the delivered Perl on your system
      untouched except by vendor-sponsored patches and updates.
      Leaving the system Perl untouched is wise, even if your system is single-user.
      On my Raspberry Pi, for example, it is almost certain that anyone
      will ever log in except for me.
      But I leave the Raspbian Perl as delivered.
      local::lib allows me to do this easily and conveniently.
      It has every feature and convenience I want.
      And reading its documentation is again an encounter with
      perfection.
      Every feature described is either something you need today,
      something you are worried you might need tomorrow,
      or something you were not worried you might need
      but should have been.
      There is nothing else.
      Perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repeated perfection can be boring,
      a fact which I suspect plays no small role in its scarcity.
      So of perlbrew,
      I will simply say that it does for Perl versions and executables
      what local::lib does for Perl modules.
      Good practice dictates that you leave the Perl delivered with
      your distribution alone,
      perlbrew is the way to manage alternative Perl executables.
      And using it,
      is a good way to study yet another perfect interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      How did Andy Lester (ack),
      Tatsuhiko Miyagawa (cpanm),
      Matt S Trout (local::lib)
      and Kang-min Liu (perlbrew) do it?
      It might be tempting to say these were simpler
      problems and that those that have seen our much-discussed failures
      are more complex and harder to define.
      That we are dealing with a fortunate choice of problem space.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I was well aware of the problem space tackled by ack and cpanm
      and it did not look simple before
      those two tools came along.
      And while the problem spaces tackled by local::lib and perlbrew seem very precisely
      defined to me now, I learned that definition from those tools --
      I am not at all sure I could have come up with it on my own.
      So the idea that these design benefit from a lucky choice of problem make me
      think of Ben Hogan's comment:
    </p>
    <blockquote>Golf is a game of luck.
      The more I practice, the luckier I get.
