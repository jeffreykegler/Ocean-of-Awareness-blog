      Marpa's SLIF (scanless interface)
      allows an application to parse straight from a BNF grammar,
      with no external lexer.
      Marpa now also allows the app to mix it own custom lexing and parsing logic
      with Marpa's,
      and to switch back and forth.
      Among other things, this allows the SLIF to do procedural parsing.

    <h3>What is procedural parsing?</h3>
    <p>Informally, you could say procedural parsing is what happens when
      you've given up on parsing algorithms -- it's hacking your way through the
      syntax using a general-purpose language.
      Before there was parsing algorithms (the first was published in 1961)
      procedural parsing was all there was.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the years after 1961, many declarative parsers were invented.
      Yacc and its LALR-based descendants dominated the textbooks for years.
      But, frankly, most programmer's have found declarative parsers
      disappointing,
      and the craft has come nearly full circle.
      Modern programmers, when they haven't fallen all the way back to regular expressions,
      focus on left parsing techniques.
      Left parsing almost always make heavy use of procedural parsing.
      In part this is because left parsing takes an intuitive path through the
      syntax, which makes procedural parsing convenient.
      And in part this is because left parsing is weak:
      left parsing by itself will not
      parse most useful grammars.
    </p>
    <h3>An example</h3>
    <p>
      Perl's here-documents are an example of a syntax which are most conveniently
      parsed using procedural techniques.
      For those unfamilar, Perl's here-documents are convenient, but their syntax
      is seriously weird.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Stuifzand recently worked out an example that parses a Perl subset
      which includes here-documents,
      and I've tweaked it for this blog post.
