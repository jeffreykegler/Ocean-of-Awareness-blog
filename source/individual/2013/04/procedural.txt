      Marpa's SLIF (scanless interface) is a parser which
      allows an application to parse straight from a BNF grammar.
      Marpa parses vast classes of grammars in linear time,
      including all those classes currently in practical use.
      With its latest release, Marpa::R2's SLIF
      also allows application to mix their own custom lexing and parsing logic
      with Marpa's,
      and to switch back and forth between them.
      Among other things, this means that Marpa's SLIF can do procedural parsing.

    <p>Modern programmers are accustomed to procedural parsing.
    And there are problems which are best tackled that way.
    Peter Stuifzand has used the just-released version of Marpa::R2 to
    tackle one of them: Perl-style here-documents.
