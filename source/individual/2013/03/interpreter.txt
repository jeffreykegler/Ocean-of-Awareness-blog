    <p>The very influential
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">
      <em>Design Patterns</em> book</a>
      lays out 23 patterns for programming.
      One of them, the Interpreter Pattern, is rarely used.
      Steve Yegge puts it a bit more strikingly -- he says
      that the book  contain 22 patterns and a practical joke.
      </p>
      <p>
      But elsewhere Yegge says that of the 23, the Interpreter pattern is
      the only one likely to shrink the size of your code,
      all the others tend to increase the amount of code it takes to solve
      the problem.
      Less code is a good thing when you're dealing with a few pages.
      If you're talking about lines of code in the 100's of thousands,
      or the millions,
      it seems more like a matter of survival.
      </p>
      <p>
      High praise as this is for the Interpreter Pattern,
      others speak even highly of it.
      A language can include all, and only, the concepts relevent
      to your domain.
      A language can allow you to relate them in all, and only, the appropriate ways.
      A language can identify errors with pinpoint precision,
      hide implementation details,
      and allow invisible "drop-in" enhancements.
      </p>
      <p>
      A language can go wrong, and in present practice, a lot do.
      Many more simply don't get off the ground.
      But because languages are so powerful and flexible,
      their use is in fact pretty much universal.
      The choice is not whether or not to use a language to solve
      the problem,
      but whether to use
      a general-purpose language,
      and a domain-specific language.
      That is, if you decide not to use a language specifically fitted
      to your domain,
      usually it means that you
      are choosing to use one that is not.
      </p>
      <p>
      Why then, is the Interpreter Pattern so little used?
      Why does Yegge call it a practical joke?
      </p>
      <h3>But there's a problem</h3>
      <p>The problem with the Interpreter Pattern is that you must
      turn your language into an AST -- you must parse it somehow.
      Simplifying the language can help here,
      but if the point is to simple at the expense of power
      and flexibility,
      why not just stick with the other 22 patterns?
      But creating a parser for a complex language
      has been a time-consuming effort,
      and one which has a high risk of disappointing results.
      Worse, it was an effort
      that had a very real risk of total failure.
      </p>
      <p>How did the Go4 deal with this?
      (The <i>Design Patterns</i> book has four authors,
      who are often called the Gang of Four, or Go4.)
      They defined the problem away.
      They stated that the parsing issue was separate from the
      Interpret Pattern, which was about what you did with the AST
      once you'd somehow come up with one.
      </p>
    <p>
      But AST's don't (so to speak) grow on trees.
      You have to get one from somewhere.
      In their example, the Go4 simply created one in their code.
      In doing this, they bypassed the BNF, and the problem parsing,
      but also the whole point of having a language.
      </p>
      <p>
      Which is why Yegge characterized the chapter as a practical joke.
      And why less ideal programming techniques and patterns are almost
      always preferred to the Interpreter Pattern.

      AST creation via Marpa's SLIF is self-hosting --
      the SLIF DSL is parsed into an AST,
      and a parser created by interpreting the AST.
      The Marpa SLIF DSL source file in this post,
      that describes boolean expressions,
      was itself turned into an AST on its way to becoming a parser
      that turns boolean expressions into AST's.
