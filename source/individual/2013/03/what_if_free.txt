    <p>In 1980, George Copeland wrote an
      article titled "What if Mass Storage were Free?".
      (It's behind a paywall
      <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=802685">here</a>.)
      Costs of mass storage were showing signs
      that they might fall dramatically.
      Copeland, as a thought exercise, took this trend to its extreme.
      Among other things, he predicted that deletion would become
      unnecessary, and in fact, undesirable.
    </p>
    <p>Copeland's
      thought experiment has proved prophetic.
      For many purposes, mass storage is treated as if it were free.
      For example, you probably retrieved this blog post from a server
      provided to me at no charge, in the hope
      that I might write and upload something interesting.

      Until now languages were high-cost efforts.
      Worse, language projects ran a high risk of disappointment,
      up to and including total failure.
      I believe those days are coming to an end.

    <h3>Small languages, shaped to the problem domain</h3>
    <p>What if whenever you needed a new language, poof, it was there?
      You would be encouraged to solve problems with new languages
      precisely shaped to the problem domain.
      Since each language is no larger than its problem domain,
      learning a language would be essentially the same as learning
      the problem domain.
      The incremental effort required to learn the language
      itself would head toward zero.
    </p>
    <h3>No more language bloat</h3>
    <p>Language bloat would end.
      Currently, the risk and cost of developing languages
      make it imperative to extend the ones we have.
      Free languages mean fewer reasons to add features
      to existing languages.
    </p>
    <h3>No more search for THE perfect language</h3>
    <p>
      No language is perfect for all tasks.
      But because the cost of languages imposes
      the need to use large, general-purpose languages,
      we are compelled to try for perfection anyway.
      Ironically, we are often making the language worse,
      and we know it.
    </p>
    <h3>A world full of perfect languages</h3>
    <p>An older sense of the word perfect is
      "having all the properties or qualities requisite to its nature and kind".
      The C language might be called perfect in this sense.
      C lacks a lot of features that are highly desirable in most contexts.
      But for programming close to the hardware, but portably,
      the C language is perfect or close to it.
    If languages were free, this is the kind of perfection
      that we would seek --
      languages precisely fitted to their domain,
      so that adding to them cannot make them better.
    </p>
    <h3>Moving toward free</h3>
    <p>
      It was many years after I read Copeland before his vision was
      anything but a pleasant daydream.
      But the plummet in the cost of languages is already underway.
      My own effort to contribute to this, the Marpa parser,
      produces a reasonable parser for every language you can write in BNF,
      from the BNF, and without futher effort.
      If the BNF is for a grammar in any of the classes currently in practical
      use, the parser Marpa produces will have linear speed.

      In one case, using Marpa,
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/4447349">a targeted language</a>
      was written
      in less than an hour.
      <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/2013/01/a-language-for-writing-languages.html">
        More typically</a>, Marpa reduce the time needed to create new languages to hours.

    <p>As one example of going from "impossible" to "easy",
      I have written a drop-in solution to an example in the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Gang
      of Four book</a>.
      The Gang of Four described a language
      and its interpretation,
      but they did not include a parser.
      Creating a parser
      to fit their example would have been
      impossibly hard when the Gang of Four wrote.
      Using Marpa, it is easy.
      The parser can be found in
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/03/bnf_to_ast.html">this
        earlier blog post</a>.

      Marpa's latest version is
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2">Marpa::R2,
        which is available on CPAN</a>.
      Recently, it has gained immensely in "whipitupitude" with
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-2.048000/pod/Scanless/DSL.pod">
        a new interface</a>,
      which has tutorials
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/01/dsl_simpler2.html">here
      </a>
      and
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2013/01/announce_scanless.html">
        here</a>.
      Marpa has
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Marpa-web-site/">a web page</a>,
      and of course it is the focus of
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/">
        my "Ocean of Awareness" blog</a>.
