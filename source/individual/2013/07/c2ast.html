</center>
  <p>
      <!--

      -->
      Jean-Damien Durand has just released
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/MarpaX-Languages-C-AST">
      MarpaX::Languages::C::AST</a>,
      which parses C language into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
      MarpaX::Languages::C::AST has been tested against
      Perl's C source code, as well as Marpa's own C source file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because it is Marpa-powered,
      MarpaX::Languages::C::AST works differently from other C parsers.
      C parsers have been either syntax-driven,
      like those parsers based on yacc,
      or based on recursive descent and procedurally-driven.
      MarpaX::Languages::C::AST uses both approaches.
      Marpa has the advantage that it makes full knowledge of the state of the parse
      available to the programmer,
      so that the two approaches can reinforce each other.
    The result is a combined lexer/parser
      which is unusually compact, easy-to-understand
      and easy to modify.
    </p>
    <h3>Applications</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Customized and customize-able "lints" -- programs to enforce C language standards
        and restrictions specific to a individual, a company or a project.
      </li>
      <li>Interpreters.
      By taking the AST and adding your own back end, you can create a special-purpose C interpreter
      or a special-purpose compiler.
      </li>
      <li>C subsets, supersets and variants.
      Because the code for the parser is compact and easy to modify,
      it lends itself to language extension and experimentation.
      Add some Perl's of syntax to C?  Why not?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>A few details</h3>
    <p>A few of Jean-Damien's implementation choices are worth singling out.
      A C parser can take one of two strategies: approximate or precise.
      A compiler has, of course, to be precise.
      Tools, such as cross-referencers, often decide to be approximate, or sloppy.
      Sloppiness is easier to implement and has other advantages:
      Compilers require the user to get all the C flags right.
      A sloppy tool can tolerate missing flags: what the flags should be
      can be one of the things it guesses at.
    </p>
    <p>Of the two strategies, Jean-Damien decided to go with "precise".
      MarpaX::Languages::C::AST follows the C11 standard,
      with either GCC or Microsoft extensions.
      This has the advantage that
      MarpaX::Languages::C::AST could be used as the front end of a compiler.
    </p>
      <p>
      Because 
      MarpaX::Languages::C::AST purpose is to take things as far an AST,
      and let the user take over,
      it does not implement those constraints usually implemented in post-processing.
      One example of a post-syntactic constraints is the one that bans
      "<tt>case</tt>" labels outside of switch statements.
      Perhaps a future version can include a default "first phase" post-processor to enforce
      the constraints from the standards.
      As currently implemented, the user can check for and enforce these constraints in any
      way he likes.
      This makes it easier for extensions and customizations,
      which I think of as the major purpose of MarpaX::Languages::C::AST.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those familar with the C's parsing and its issues.
      MarpaX::Languages::C::AST is almost entirely syntax-driven -- the parser works
      from Marpa's SLIF, an extended BNF variant.
      This is sufficient to deal with the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_else">if-then-else issue</a>.
      Marpa handles right recursion in linear time,
      so that the if-then-else issue could have been dealt with by rewriting the relevant rules.
      But Jean-Damien wanted to have his grammar follow closely that in the standards,
      and he decided to use Marpa's rule ranking facility instead.
      </p>
      <p>More complicated is the ambiguity in C between variable names and types,
      which actually takes C beyond BNF and context-free grammars into context-sensitive
      territory.
    Most C parsers deal with this with
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_lexer_hack">lexer 
      and/or post-processing hacks</a>.
      Marpa allows the parser to do this more elegantly.
      Marpa knows the parsing context at all times and can comnunicate this to a user's
      customized lexing code.
      It also allows the parser to switch back and forth between customized parsing and
      its own internal parsing.
      The resulting code, and parser, is much simpler and clearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Potential uses of MarpaX::Languages::C::AST includes tools, interpreters
      and compilers for the C language.
      This code is open source, and is much easier basis on which
      to create C language supersets and subsets than
      previous C parsers.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>Compilers?</h3>
    <p>
      Above I mentioned special-purpose compilers.
      What about productions compilers?
      MarpaX::Languages::C::AST's upper layers are in Perl,
      so the speed, while acceptable for special-purpose tools,
      will not be adequate for production.
      Perhaps a future Marpa-powered C parser will rewrite those
      upper layers in C, making the race much closer.
