      <p>My recent work has been on tools for ambiguous parsing.
      Marpa, my parser project, has long allowed users to generate and examine all
      the parses of an ambiguous parse,
      which was more than enough for most purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
      But there are users who want to efficiently manipulate large sets of ambiguous parses.
      My new work allows the creation of an Abstract Syntax Forest (ASF)
      An ASF, as the name suggests, is a collection of Abstract Syntax Trees.
      The trick in designing an ASF is to make it efficient -- a simple set of fully expanded
      AST's can quickly become exponential in the size of the input,
      and unusable in practice.
      In fully expanded AST's, many of the subtrees will be identical.
      To be reasonably efficient,
      ASF's need to take advantage of this duplication of information.
    <h3>Ada Lovelace's Quote</h3>
    <p>Ada Lovelace's wrote the first paper
    separates computing and software, on one hand,
    from caculating and hardware, on the other.
    These ideas were hers.
    She worked with Charles Babbage,
    and the hardware design was entirely his work,
    as was much of the actual coding.
    <p>
    But Babbage was not a mathematician.
    More importantly, he was caught up in
    a world view where God had arranged matters so that reason
    was the exclusive province of human beings.
    These days children, not long after they learn to talk,
    come to understand that games and game machines are two
    distinct things,
    and that while the game software is intangible,
    it is nonetheless a very real thing
    and necessary to "animate" the game machine.
    For Babbage, his comtemporaries and almost everyone for the next century,
    thinking out the implications of
    intangible things which animate things which are not human beings
    was way too Mary Shelley.
    <p>Babbage 
    As <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/hpb.html">his son put it</a>,
    Babbage considered
    <blockquote>
    the Paper by Menabrea, translated with notes by Lady Lovelace,
    published in volume 3 of Taylor's 'Scientific Memoirs," as quite disposing of the mathematical aspect of the invention.
    <blockquote>
    <h3>On reading Ada</h3>
    <p>If you reread Ada's notes, "quite disposes" understates the case.
    For example, she clearly understood the interchangeability of data and program,
    and that programs could (and should) maninpulate other programs.
    <p>Ada's notes are still worth reading and pondering,
    but they present a lot of difficulties to the modern reader.
    Among them:
    <ul>
    <li>They are in Victorian English.  Long, complex sentences were encouraged,
    and considered especially appropriate when making an difficult and important point.</li>
    <li>They are mathemtical, and focus on areas of math, such as the method of differences,
    which are not important for modern computer programmers.
    <li>Ada does not have her terminology ready-made.
    For example, she speaks of attaching symbol results, which she clearly understand
    can represent operations, to numeric data, which she clearly understands can in fact
    represent not just numbers, but notes, positions in a loom, or computer operations.
    So is she talking about objects and methods?
    </ul>
    <h3>The quote</h3>
<blockquote>
Those who view mathematical science,
not merely as a vast body of abstract and immutable truths,
whose intrinsic beauty,
symmetry and logical completeness,
when regarded in their connexion together as a whole,
entitle them to a prominent place in the interest of all profound
and logical minds,
but as possessing a yet deeper interest for the human race,
when it is remembered that this science constitutes the language
through which alone we can adequately express the great facts of
the natural world,
and those unceasing changes of mutual relationship which,
visibly or invisibly,
consciously or unconsciously to our immediate physical perceptions,
are interminably going on in the agencies of the creation we live amidst:
those who thus think on mathematical truth as the instrument through
which the weak mind of man can most effectually read his Creator's
works,
will regard with especial interest all that can tend to facilitate
the translation of its principles into explicit practical forms.
</blockquote>
