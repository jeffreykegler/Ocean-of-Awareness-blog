Making DSL's even simpler

  <p>In a previous post, I talked about making domain-specific languages
  easier to write -- so easy they become a common approach to problem solving.
  No tool is as powerful and targeted for dealing with a problem as a custom
  language.
  The obstacle has been that DSL's have been very difficult to write.
  <p>Recently, another Marpa user, Peter Stuifzand, set out to write a JSON
  parser using Marpa::R2's new Scanless interface.
  Thirty minutes and 152 lines of code later, he was finished.
  <p>Peter's effort has what is, by many criteria, superior competition.
  JSON::PP is more polished and faster.
  But JSON::PP is 2917 lines of code, and presumably took weeks to write.
  JSON::XS is even faster, but it is 50% longer and half in C,
  and it is safe to say took much longer to write and is harder to
  maintain than JSON::PP.
  <p>The initial version of Marpa's Scanless interface was written
  to optimize whip-it-upitude.
