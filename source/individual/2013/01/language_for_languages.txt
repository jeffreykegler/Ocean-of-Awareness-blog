      The Scanless interface is not yet two weeks old, but at this point
      I have reports from its users of completed applications.
      Significantly, two of them are for work.
      <h3>A JSON Parser</h3>
      The non work-related application is a JSON parser.
      Obviously, it easily <b>could</b> be work-related,
      and given it's available as gist,
      it may well be in production use by someone somewhere.
      It was written by Peter Stuifzand,
      runs 185 lines
      and took him less than 30 minutes to write.
      With Marpa's Scanless interface, it was a matter of
      typing in the grammar,
      and add a few Perl functions to provide the semantics.
      <p>There are, of course, other JSON parsers out there,
      and many of which run faster.
      These, however, took weeks to write.
      If you are, for example, thinking of extending JSON,
      and development time is a consideration,
      the Marpa-based solution may be the one for you.
