    <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-R2">
        Marpa::R2</a>'s
      Scanless interface is now out of beta and in full release.
      This interface allows Marpa to be used without the need to create
      a separate lexer (scanner),
      and increases Marpa's level of "whipitupitude".
      Here's what a simple calculator looks like in the Scanless interface:
      <blockquote>
      <pre>
:start ::= Script
Script ::= Expression+ separator =&gt; comma action =&gt; do_script
comma ~ [,]
Expression ::=
    Number
    | '(' Expression ')' action =&gt; do_parens assoc =&gt; group
   || Expression '**' Expression action =&gt; do_pow assoc =&gt; right
   || Expression '*' Expression action =&gt; do_multiply
    | Expression '/' Expression action =&gt; do_divide
   || Expression '+' Expression action =&gt; do_add
    | Expression '-' Expression action =&gt; do_subtract
Number ~ [\d]+
 
:discard ~ whitespace
whitespace ~ [\s]+
# allow comments
:discard ~ &lt;hash comment&gt;
&lt;hash comment&gt; ~ &lt;terminated hash comment&gt; | &lt;unterminated
   final hash comment&gt;
&lt;terminated hash comment&gt; ~ '#' &lt;hash comment body&gt; &lt;vertical space char&gt;
&lt;unterminated final hash comment&gt; ~ '#' &lt;hash comment body&gt;
&lt;hash comment body&gt; ~ &lt;hash comment char&gt;*
&lt;vertical space char&gt; ~ [\x{A}\x{B}\x{C}\x{D}\x{2028}\x{2029}]
&lt;hash comment char&gt; ~ [^\x{A}\x{B}\x{C}\x{D}\x{2028}\x{2029}]
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>The full example, with semantics,
    is in <a href="https://gist.github.com/4440418">
    a Github gist</a>.
     It is almost identical to the example in
    the Scanless interface documents, and to a test in Marpa::R2's test suite.

    Simultaneously,
    <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-2.038000/pod/BNF.pod">
    Marpa's BNF interface</a>
    is coming out of beta and into full release.
    Like the Scanless interface,
    the BNF interface allows you to write your grammar in a BNF variant.
    Unlike the Scanless interface, it requires you to do your own lexing.
    <p>The Scanless interface is a superset of the BNF interface, so its documentation
    is the best place to start for learning both.
    However, to work with either, you probably should already
    have at least some familiarity with
    <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-2.038000/pod/Marpa_R2.pod">Marpa's
    standard interface</a>.

      Not long ago, my work on Marpa was very much a lone endeavour.
      A sign of Marpa's emergence is my uses and extensions of Marpa
      now are often based on insights and advances from others.
      The BNF interface is based on ideas pioneered by Peter Stuifzand.
      Any the approach to scannerless parsing that I finally settled on
      was suggested to me by Andrew Rodland's prior work on pairing Marpa grammars.
