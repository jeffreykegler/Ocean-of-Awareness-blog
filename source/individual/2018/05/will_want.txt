      What, going forward, will you want in a parser?
      The question may sound presumptious
      (how do I know what you want, much less what you
      <b>will</b> want) but I think it can be answered
      with some confidence.
      The way to do this is to look at what you
      have wanted in the past,
      with "you" being represented by a wide
      variety of top practitioners and theorists.

    In this post,
    the parser I am speaking of is the mainframe parser --
    the one that is used in state of the art parser generators.
    In many situations, of course, what you want is the fastest
    and easiest parser that gets the job done.
    Often that job is quite narrowly defined,
    and therefore
    the parser can be quite limited in its power,
    especially if it's fast and easy to deploy.
    For example, when you have a regular expression to parse,
    you're not looking for anything more than a regular expression
    engine.
    </p>
    <p>
    But regular expressions themselves
    are an example of one important property that you will
    want in a parser.
    They are predictably and reliably fast.
    "Fast" here means they are linear or quasi-linear.
    "Predictably" means that they are fast for a predictable
    set of grammars.
    In the case of regular expressions,
    it is not hard to determine if a grammar is a regular expression --
    you can in fact define a notation so that
    <b>only</b> regular expressions are allowed,
    so that a programmer doesn't even need to desk-check.
    </p>
    <p>
    "Reliably" means the parser is fast for 100% of the predicted cases.
    This would go without saying,
    except that solutions to the parsing problem are often advanced
    which trade power for reliability.
