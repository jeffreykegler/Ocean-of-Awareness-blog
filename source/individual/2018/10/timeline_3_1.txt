    <h2>Announcing Parsing Timeline 3.1</h2>
    <p>I have just released
    <a href=
    "https://jeffreykegler.github.io/personal/timeline_v3">
    version 3.1 of my Parsing Timeline</a>.
    It is a painless introduction to
    a fascinating and important story
    which is scattered among
    one of the most
    forbidding literatures in computer science.
    Previous versions of this timeline have been,
    by far,
    the most popular of my writings.
    </p>
    <p>A third of Timeline 3.1 is new,
    added since the 3.0 version.
    Much of the new material is adapted from previous
    blog posts, both old and recent.
    Other material is completely new.
    The sections that are not new with 3.1
    has been carefully reviewed and
    heavily revised.
    </p>
    <h2>Comments, etc.</h2>
    <p>My interest in parsing stems from my 
    own approach to it -- a parser in the Earley/Leo
    lineage named Marpa.
    To learn more about Marpa,
      a good first stop is the
      <a href="http://savage.net.au/Marpa.html">semi-official web site, maintained by Ron Savage</a>.
      The official, but more limited, Marpa website
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Marpa-web-site/">is my personal one</a>.
      Comments on this post can be made in
      <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/marpa-parser">
        Marpa's Google group</a>,
      or on our IRC channel: #marpa at freenode.net.
