      My most popular blog posts by far have been my two versions of "Parsing: a timeline".
      I have just created
      <a href="https://jeffreykegler.github.io/personal/timeline_v3">a
        3rd version</a>,
      which has so many changes
      that it might be considered a new work.
      The new version is less Marpa-centric and several times as long.
      It covers new topics, including combinator and monadic
      parsing, and operator expression parsing.
      And sources are now provided for all material.

      Marpa, my own parsing project,
      there is the
      <a href="http://savage.net.au/Marpa.html">semi-official web site, maintained by Ron Savage</a>.
      The official, but more limited, Marpa website
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Marpa-web-site/">is my personal one</a>.
