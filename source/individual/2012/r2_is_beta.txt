Marpa::R2 is beta
The most recent indexed release of Marpa::R2 is beta.
Marpa is a new parsing algorithm,
based on decades of prior work.
It is a practical and efficient solution
targeted at all parsing problems that are too
complex for regular expressions.
<p>
The Marpa::R2 module is the most recent Marpa module.
Marpa is also available as the Marpa::XS module,
which is stable and bug-fix only.
The Marpa algorithm, and both
Marpa modules:
<ol>
<li><p>Parse everything you can write in BNF.
<li><p>Parse in times considered theoretically optimal.
For unambiguous grammars, Marpa is never worse than O(n²).
For ambiguous grammars, Marpa is never worse than O(n³).
Marpa never goes exponential.
<li><p>
Parse all
classes of grammar in practical use today in linear time.
<li><p>
Are fully aware, at every point in the parse, of
all the rules they are parsing,
how far into them they has proceeded,
and of what tokens they expects next.
This information is available
to the application
conveniently and efficiently.
<li><p>
Do not need to be handwritten.
Marpa is available as a open-source library.
It is written in C,
and the C library can be used
<a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Marpa/libmarpa.html">
directly</a>
or via
<a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-R2">
a Perl interface</a>.
<li><p>
For general BNF parsing,
do not require
the user to craft
a lookahead or backtracking strategy -- Marpa
does not use lookahead and never backtracks.
<li><p>
Come
with the traditional theoretical apparatus of
proofs based on prior literature.
