A Marpa-based HTML reformatter
This post focuses on
<code>html_fmt</code>,
a tidier for liberal HTML.
<code>html_fmt</code> indents HTML according to structure,
in the process
adding missing start and end tags and identifying "cruft".
<code>html_fmt</code> is ultra-liberal about its input.
Like a browser's rendering engine,
<code>html_fmt</code> never rejects a file,
no matter how clearly defective it is as an HTML document.
In fact, an interesting experiment is to compare what your
favorite browser does with a random text file feed to
it directly,
and then passed through <code>html_fmt</code>.

<p>
<code>html_fmt</code> is a by-product of moving

this blog to Github</a>.
In the course of bringing over
<a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/metapages/chronological.html">
my old posts</a>,
I wanted a filter that would tidy them up,
and turned to an old Marpa demo I'd written.

Its usefulness was a pleasant surprise,
but it lacked two features.
First, it wouldn't read from standard input.
Second, in formatting the HTML, it introduced new whitespace.
The first problem was easy to fix.
Fixing the second involved coming up with a
"lowest common denominator" for whitespace treatment
among browsers and HTML variants.

I making <code>html_fmt</code> result available as a 
gist.
It is very well-suited as a first step in dealing with HTML
that you are rewriting by hand.
One quick pass-through and your file is much easier to read,
has all the proper tags,
and has comments pointing out any "cruft" that's there.
And, from a "less is more" point of view,
it's a good start on a production-quality tool.
