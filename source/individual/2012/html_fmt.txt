A Marpa-based HTML reformatter
    <p>
      <!--

      This post focuses on
      <tt>html_fmt</tt>,
      a reformatter ("tidier") for liberal HTML.
      <tt>html_fmt</tt>
      indents HTML according to the structure of the document,
      which makes it a lot easier to read.
      In the process
      <tt>html_fmt</tt>
      adds missing start and end tags and identifies "cruft".
    </p>
    <p>
      <tt>html_fmt</tt>
      is ultra-liberal about its input.
      Like a browser's rendering engine,
      <tt>html_fmt</tt>
      never rejects a file,
      no matter how clearly defective it is as an HTML document.
      An interesting experiment would be to compare what your
      favorite browser does with a random text file feed to
      it directly,
      with what it does to the same file
      after it has been passed through
      <tt>html_fmt</tt>.

      is a by-product of moving
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/">
        this blog to Github
      </a>.
      In the course of bringing over
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/metapages/chronological.html">
        my old posts
      </a>,
      I wanted a filter that would tidy them up,
      and turned to an old Marpa demo I'd written.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its usefulness was a pleasant surprise,
      but it lacked two features.
      First, it wouldn't read from standard input.
      Second, in formatting the HTML, it introduced new whitespace.
      The first problem was easy to fix.
      Fixing the second involved coming up with a
      "lowest common denominator" for whitespace treatment
      among browsers and HTML variants.

    <p>
      I making
      <tt>html_fmt</tt>
      result available as a
      gist.
      It is very well-suited as a first step in dealing with HTML
      that you are rewriting by hand.
      One quick pass-through and your file is much easier to read,
      has all the proper tags,
      and has comments pointing out any "cruft" that's there.
    </p>
    <p>
      A production quality "tidier" would need to be something like
      <tt>gnuindent</tt>
      --
      bristling with options.
      <tt>html_fmt</tt>
      so far has only two choices: strategies for avoiding added whitespace.
      The default is to add comments, which keeps the indentation correct,
      but looks cluttered.
      The alternative is to simply leave whitespace-sensitive
      text as is, which avoids
      clutter, but makes the structure of document harder to follow.
      These two options are not
      sufficient to deal with all whitespace issues,
      and which I prefer depends very much on the situation.

      From a
      <a href="http://blog.plover.com/oops/blosxom-sux.html">
        "Worse is Better"</a>
      point of view,
      it's a good start on a production-quality tool.
      It is 600 lines,
      short enough to find your
      way around in,
      particularly after you've deleted the parts you don't like.
      And its underlying Marpa-based interface is documented:
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::HTML">
        Marpa::R2::HTML</a>.
      Marpa::R2::HTML is beta, but has been stable for some time.
