Smart Whitespace and the Ruby Slippers
  <h3>Scannerless parsing</h3>

      I've been working,
      (and am quite far along)
      on a Marpa interface that does not require a lexer (aka scanner).
      The lexing is included in the parser.
      Here one example that I have working:
      the synopsis from
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2">
      the main Marpa::R2 POD page</a>,
      rewritten to do its own lexing.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
    <tt>
:start ::= Expression
Expression ::=
       Number
    || Expression '*' Expression action => do_multiply
    || Expression '+' Expression action => do_add
Number ~ digits '.' digits action => do_literal
Number ~ digits action => do_literal
digits ~ [\d]+
    </tt>
      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here the notation is that of my last post,
    as documented here.
    New for the scannerless parser is
    <ul>
    <li>
    the <tt>:start</tt>
    pseudo-symbol, which indicates the start rule
    <li>
    Rules with a tilde ("<tt>~</tt>") to separate 
    LHS from RHS: these indicate rules whose
    whitespace is to be left as-is.
    <li>Single-quoted strings, to tell Marpa which
    character to look for.
    <li>Square-bracketed character classes, to
    tell Marpa to look for a class of characters.
    Their interpretation is done by Perl,
    and therefore the allowed classes are exactly those
    accepted by your version of Perl.
    </ul>
    <p>My recent posts has been tutorial.
    My work on scannerless parsing is well advanced,
    but not quite ready for a tutorial presentation,
    so this post will be conceptual.
    It will discuss an interesting issues that arises in
    scannerless parsing,
    one which Perl 6 also had to solve,
    and which Marpa solves it in a new and different way.
    That issue is whitespace.

    <h3>Dealing with whitespace</h3>
    <p>For the statements with a declaration operator of <tt>::=</tt>,
    whitespace is handled automatically by Marpa.
    Valid strings in the above language, are
    "<tt>42*3+7</tt>",
    "<tt>42 * 3 + 7</tt>" and
    "<tt>42 * 3+7</tt>",
    all which yield 133 as the answer.
    One trick is to, on one hand, allow whitespace to be optional
    and, on the other hand, recognize that strings like "<tt>42</tt>"
    must be a single number.
    That is the parser should not recognizer optional whitespace
    between the two digits and decide there are two numbers:
    "<tt>4</tt>" and 
    "<tt>2</tt>".
    </p>
    <p>
    The Perl 6 project has already taken on scannerless parsing,
    and it can solve problems of this sort using "smart whitespace".
    Smart whitespace is whitespace which is optional, except between
    word characters.
    Stated another way, smart whitespace is either explicit whitespace,
    or a word boundary.
    (The term "smart whitespace" is mine,
    but the idea is from Perl 6.)
    In the case of "<tt>42</tt>",
    "<tt>4</tt>" and 
    "<tt>2</tt>" are both word characters, so there is no
    word boundary between them, and therefore no smart whitespace.
