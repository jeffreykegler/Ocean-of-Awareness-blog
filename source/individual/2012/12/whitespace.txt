Smart whitespace and the Ruby Slippers
  <h3>Scannerless parsing</h3>
    <p>
      <!--

      -->
      I've been working
      on a "scannerless" Marpa interface.
      "Scannerless" means that the user does not need to write
      a separate lexer --
      the lexer (scanner) is included in the parser.
      One of my working examples is
      the synopsis from
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2">
      the main Marpa::R2 POD page</a>,
      rewritten to do its own lexing:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
    <tt>
:start ::= Expression
Expression ::=
       Number
    || Expression '*' Expression action => do_multiply
    || Expression '+' Expression action => do_add
Number ~ digits '.' digits action => do_literal
Number ~ digits action => do_literal
digits ~ [\d]+
    </tt>
      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here the notation is that of
    <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2012/11/iterative.html">
    my last post</a>,
    as
    <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::BNF">
    documented here</a>.
    New for the scannerless parser are
    <ul>
    <li>
    the <tt>:start</tt>
    pseudo-symbol, which indicates the start rule;
    <li>
    rules with a tilde ("<tt>~</tt>") to separate 
    LHS from RHS: these indicate rules whose
    whitespace is to be left as-is
    <li>single-quoted strings, to tell Marpa which
    character to look for; and
    <li>square-bracketed character classes, to
    tell Marpa to look for a class of characters.
    Their interpretation is done by Perl,
    and therefore the allowed classes are exactly those
    accepted by your version of Perl.
    </ul>
    <p>
    Valid strings in this language are "<tt>15329 + 42 * 290 * 711</tt>",
    "<tt>42*3+7</tt>",
    "<tt>3*3+4* 4</tt>",
    along with all their whitespace variants.
    </p>
    <p>My recent posts have been tutorial.
    My work on scannerless parsing is
    not quite ready for a tutorial presentation,
    so this post will be conceptual.
    It is about an interesting issue that arises in
    scannerless parsing,
    one which Perl 6 also had to solve,
    and which Marpa solves it in a new and different way.
    That issue is whitespace.
    </p>
    <h3>Dealing with whitespace</h3>
    <p>For the statements with a declaration operator of <tt>::=</tt>,
    whitespace is handled automatically by Marpa.
    Valid strings in the above language, are
    "<tt>42*3+7</tt>",
    "<tt>42 * 3 + 7</tt>" and
    "<tt>42 * 3+7</tt>",
    all which yield 133 as the answer.
    The trick is to, on one hand, allow whitespace to be optional
    and, on the other hand, recognize that strings like "<tt>42</tt>"
    must be a single number.
    That is, the parser should not recognize optional whitespace
    between the two digits and decide that
    "<tt>42</tt>",
    is actually two numbers:
    "<tt>4</tt>" and 
    "<tt>2</tt>".
    </p>
    <p>
    The Perl 6 project has already taken on scannerless parsing.
    My methods for dealing with whitespace are based on theirs.
    Central to
    their solution is "smart whitespace".
    ("Smart whitespace" is my term --
    the
    <a href="http://perlcabal.org/syn/S05.html">
    Perl 6 doc</a>
    is more matter-of-fact.)
    Smart whitespace is whitespace which is optional, except between
    word characters.
    Stated another way, smart whitespace is either explicit whitespace,
    or a word boundary.
    In the case of "<tt>42</tt>",
    "<tt>4</tt>" and 
    "<tt>2</tt>" are both word characters, so there is no
    word boundary between them, and therefore no smart whitespace.
    </p>
    <h3>Implementing smart whitespace</h3>
    <p>
    Left parsers (like that which Perl 6 uses)
    often know very little about the context of the parse.
    But left parsers do know the current "character transition" --
    what the previous character was,
    and what the current character is.
    In a left parser, finding word boundaries for the
    purpose of detecting smart whitespace fits in
    nicely with the way it works in general.
    </p>
    <p>Marpa, of course,
    also knows the previous and current characters.
    It is certainly possible for
    Marpa to check every transition for a word boundary.
    But in Marpa's case, this check would
    be an additional overhead, covering just one special case.
    It'd be nice if we could look for word boundaries in a cool Marpa-ish way,
    preferably one with efficiency advantages.
    </p>
    <h3>Out come the Ruby Slippers</h3>
    <p>"Ruby Slippers" parsing, as a reminder, is new with Marpa,
    despite seeming a very obvious concept.
    It amounts to adjusting the input to the parser based on what
    the parser wants.
    This can be seen as telling the parser that whatever it wishes
    for will happen, the same power that was conferred on Dorothy
    in <em>Wizard of Oz</em> by a happy choice of footware.
    </p>
    <p>
    To make the Ruby Slippers work in this case,
    we make a word boundary a special kind of virtual token,
    and we define smart whitespace as either real, physical whitespace
    or that virtual token.
    We then proceed normally with the parse.
    </p>
    <p>
    We continue with the parse until there's a problem.
    At that point we ask the parser if it is looking for one
    of the virtual word boundary tokens.
    If so, we give it one and continue.
    Why does life have to be difficult?
