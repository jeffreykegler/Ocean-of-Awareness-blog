    This post is about how to write a parser complex parser a little bit
    at a time, testing as you go.
    You could also call this approach test-driven.
    This tutorial will "iterate" a parser one development step.
    The parser we will use is the one from
    <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2012/11/pattern_search.html">
    the last tutorial</a>,
    which parsed a Perl subset.
    </p>
    <p>
    You may recall that the topic of that previous tutorial was pattern search.
    Pattern search and iterative parser development are
    essentially the same thing,
    and the same approach can be used for both.
    Each development stage of our Perl parser will do a pattern search
    for the Perl subset it parses.
    We can use the accuracy of this pattern search
    to check our progress.
    The subset we are attempting to parse is our "search target".
    When our "searches" succeed in finding all instances
    of the target,
    we have successfully written a parser for that subset,
    and can move on to the next step of the iteration.
    </p>
    <h3>What we need to do</h3>
    <p>
    This tutorial is the latest of
    <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/metapages/annotated.html#TUTORIAL">
    a series</a>,
    each of which describes one self-contained template.
    In this tutorial we will take
    <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2012/11/pattern_search.html">
    the previous tutorial</a>
    as the first iteration in the iterative development of a Perl parser.
     In the iteration in this example, we will add two features.
     <ul>
     <li><p>The previous iteration was more of a recognizer than a parser.
     In particular, its grammar was too simplified to support a semantics,
     even for the Perl subset it recognized.
     We will fix that.
     <li>Having amplified the grammar, we will add a semantics,
     simple, but quite powerful enough to use in checking our progress
     in developing the parser.
     </ul>
     <h3>The grammar</h3>
     <p>Here  is our grammar from the previous post, all eight lines of it:
     <blockquote>
      <pre>
    <tt>
start ::= prefix target
prefix ::= any_token*
target ::= expression
expression ::=
       number | scalar | scalar postfix_op
    || op_lparen expression op_rparen assoc =&gt; group
    || unop expression
    || expression binop expression`
    </tt>
    </pre>
    </blockquote>
     These eight lines were enough to descibe arithmetic expressions sufficiently well
     for a recognizer, as well as to provide the "scaffolding" for the unanchored search.
     Nice compression, but now that we are talking about supporting a Perl semantics,
     we will need more.
     <p>Adding the appropriate grammar is a matter of turning to the
     <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html#Operator-Precedence-and-Associativity">
     appropriate section of the <tt>perlop</tt> man page</a>
     and copying it.
     I needed to change the format and come up with name for all the operators,
     but the process is pretty much rote, as you can see:
     <blockquote>
      <pre>
    <tt>
my $perl_grammar = Marpa::R2::Grammar-&gt;new(
    {   start          =&gt; 'start',
        actions        =&gt; 'main',
        default_action =&gt; 'do_what_I_mean',
        rules          =&gt; [ &lt;&lt;'END_OF_RULES' ]
start ::= prefix target action =&gt; do_arg1
prefix ::= any_token* action =&gt; do_undef
target ::= expression action =&gt; do_target
expression ::=
     number
   | scalar
   | op_lparen expression op_rparen assoc =&gt; group
  || op_predecrement expression
   | op_preincrement expression
   | expression op_postincrement
   | expression op_postdecrement
  || expression op_starstar expression assoc =&gt; right
  || op_uminus expression
   | op_uplus expression
   | op_bang expression
   | op_tilde expression
  || expression op_star expression
   | expression op_slash expression
   | expression op_percent expression
   | expression kw_x expression
  || expression op_plus expression
   | expression op_minus expression
  || expression op_ltlt expression
   | expression op_gtgt expression
  || expression op_ampersand expression
  || expression op_vbar expression
   | expression op_caret expression
  || expression op_equal expression assoc =&gt; right
  || expression op_comma expression
END_OF_RULES
    }
);
    </tt>
    </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>The lexer</h3>
    <p>
    The lexer is table-driven.
    I've used this same approach to lexing in every post
    in this tutorial series.
    Those interested in
    an explanation of how the lexer works can
    <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2012/dsl.html">
    find one in the first tutorial</a>.
    Having broken out the operators, I had to rewrite
    the lexing table,
    but that was even more more rote than the rewriting
    the grammar.
    I won't repeat the 
    lexer table here --
    it can be found in
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/4093504">the Github gist</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Adding the semantics</h3>
    <p>Our semantics will create a syntax tree.
    Here is most of the logic.
    (Note that the first argument is a per-parse "object",
    which we don't use here.)
     <blockquote>
      <pre>
    <tt>
sub do_undef       { undef; }
sub do_arg1        { $_[2]; }
sub do_what_I_mean { shift; return $_[0] if scalar @_ == 1; return \@_ }

sub do_target {
    my $origin = ( Marpa::R2::Context::location() )[0];
    return if $origin != $ORIGIN;
    return $_[1];
} ## end sub do_target
    </tt>
    </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    There is some special logic in the <tt>do_target</tt> method,
    involving the "origin", or starting location of the target.
    This method allows for ambiguous targets,
    and in fact perl arithmetic expressions,
    as the target of an unanchored search,
    are ambiguous.
    For example, in the string "<tt>abc 1 + 2 + 3 xyz</tt>",
    there are two targets ending at the same position:
    "<tt>2 + 3</tt>" and "<tt>1 + 2 + 3</tt>".
    We are interested only in longest of these.
    whose beginning is indicated by the "<tt>$ORIGIN</tt>"
    variable.
    <p>The next logic will be familiar from our
    <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/individual/2012/11/pattern_search.html">
    pattern search tutorial</a>.
    It repeatedly looks for non-overlapping occurrences of <tt>target</tt>,
    starting from the end and going back to the beginning of the input.
     <blockquote>
      <pre>
    <tt>
my $end_of_search;
my @results = ();
RESULTS: while (1) {
    my ( $origin, $end ) =
        $self-&gt;last_completed_range( 'target', $end_of_search );
    last RESULTS if not defined $origin;
    push @results, [ $origin, $end ];
    $end_of_search = $origin;
} ## end RESULTS: while (1)
    </tt>
    </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This final code sample is the logic
    that unites pattern search with incremental 
    parsing.
    It is a loop through <tt>@results</tt>
    prints the original text,
    and, depending on flags,
    its syntax tree.
    </p>
    <p>
    Near the top of the loop,
    "<tt>$recce-&gt;set( { end =&gt; $end } )</tt>"
    call sets the end of parse location to the current
    result.
    At the bottom of the loop,
    we call
    "<tt>$recce-&gt;reset_evaluation()</tt>".
    This is necessary to allow us to evaluate the
    input stream again, but with a new
    <tt>$end</tt> location.
    </p>
     <blockquote>
      <pre>
    <tt>
RESULT: for my $result ( reverse @results ) {
    my ( $origin, $end ) = @{$result};

    <big><b>... Print out the original text ...</b></big>

    $recce-&gt;set( { end =&gt; $end } );
    my $value;
    VALUE: while ( not defined $value ) {
        local $main::ORIGIN = $origin;
        my $value_ref = $recce-&gt;value();
        last VALUE if not defined $value_ref;
        $value = ${$value_ref};
    } ## end VALUE: while ( not defined $value )
    if ( not defined $value ) {
        say 'No parse'
            or die "say() failed: $ERRNO";
        next RESULT;
    }
    say Data::Dumper::Dumper($value)
        or die "say() failed: $ERRNO"
        if not $quiet_flag;
    $recce-&gt;reset_evaluation();
} ## end RESULT: for my $result ( reverse @results )
    </tt>
    </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The <tt>VALUE</tt> sub-loop is
    where the <tt>$ORIGIN</tt> variable
    was set.
    In the semantics, <tt>do_target</tt>
    checks this.
    In the case of an ambiguous parse,
    <tt>do_target</tt> turns all those targets which do not
    cover the full span from <tt>$origin</tt> to <tt>$end</tt>
    into Perl <tt>undef</tt>'s,
    which will be passed up as the value of the parse.
    The logic in the <tt>VALUE</tt> loop
    catches these, and throws the undefs away,
    so that only the longest target for each <tt>$end</tt>
    location is printed.
