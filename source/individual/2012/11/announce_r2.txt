      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-R2">
        Marpa::R2</a>
      is now in full, official release.
      For those new to this blog, Marpa::R2 is an efficient, practical general
      BNF parser, targeted at applications too complex for
      regular expressions.
      Marpa::R2 is based on
      <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Marpa-web-site/">
        the Marpa parsing algorithm</a>.
      New, but squarely based on the published literature,
      the Marpa algorithm
      parses every class of grammar in practical use today
      in linear time.
    </p>
    <p>Marpa::R2 is the successor to Marpa::XS and
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>installs and runs on Windows.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>has better error reporting.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>is faster.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          has a cleaner, simpler interface.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::XS">Marpa::XS</a>
    remains available and,
      since changes to it are now on a "bug fix only" basis,
      should be quite stable.
      While Marpa::R2's interface will have a familiar look
      to users of Marpa::XS, it is not fully compatible:
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Changes">
      changes are documented here</a>.

    <p>
      Those who have been following this blog may have noticed
      that
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2::Changes">
      a new BNF interface</a>
      has been added to Marpa::R2.
      This is growing --
      I am currently adding scannerless parsing to it,
      which means that applications will be able to run
      Marpa::R2 without a lexer.
      Because the BNF interface is new
      and still under very active development,
      it is being kept in beta status for the time being.

    <p>
      The Windows port of Marpa was the work of Jean-Damien Durand,
      who utilized Alberto Sim&otilde;es'
      <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Config-AutoConf/">
        Config::AutoConf</a>.
