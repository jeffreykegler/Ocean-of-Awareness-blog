  Marpa::R2</a> is now in full, official release.
  For those new to this blog, Marpa::R2 is an efficient, practical general
  BNF parser, targeted at parsing application too complex for
  regular expressions.
  Marpa::R2 is based on
  <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.com/Marpa-web-site/">
  the Marpa parsing algorithm</a>,
  New but based on the published literature,
  the Marpa algorithm
  parses every class of grammar in practical use today
  in linear time.

  and has these new features:
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p>runs on Windows.
  </p>
  <li>
  <p>has better error reporting.
  </p>
  <li>
