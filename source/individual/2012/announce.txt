A new home for the Ocean of Awareness blog
The folks at <a href="blogs.perl.org">blogs.perl.org</a>
has provided
my Ocean of Awareness blog
a wonderful home for some time.
But the call of static blogging is becoming impossible to resist.
A <a href="http://jeffreykegler.github.io/Ocean-of-Awareness-blog/">
github based site</a>
will, most likely, soon
become the new home
of the Ocean of Awareness blog.
<p>
One consideration still up in the air is comments on the blog.
For some bloggers, the loss of comments has been one of the
attractions of static blogging,
but comments have been valuable to me.
I've heard of Disqus being used for comments on static blogs,
and I'm looking into that.
<p>
For those who want to comment
in the meantime,
if the post is Marpa-related,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#%21forum/marpa-parser">
the Marpa mailing list</a>
is a good place to comment.
Also,
I will continue to dual-post for some time,
and have not yet frozen comments on the versions of the
post at
<a href="blogs.perl.org">blogs.perl.org</a>.
