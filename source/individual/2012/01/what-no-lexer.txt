What!  No Lexer?
<p>
To those who have noted that
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::XS">
Marpa::XS</a>
does not come with a lexer,
I'd respond that,
in a very real sense it does --
Perl.
Perl5 is a powerful lexical analyzer.
</p>
<p>
If you're trying to figure out how to write your first Marpa
parser,
I'd recommend a close look at 
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/wolfgang_kinkeldei/2011/12/trying-marpa-to-parse-css.html">
Wolfgang Kinkeldei's recent posting about his
Marpa-powered CSS parser</a>.
Wolfgang lays his parser out in a very elegant fashion,
and I find his code makes an excellent template.
</p>
Especially nice-looking is Wolfgang's lexer.
Wolfgang follows one of the two
main strategies for lexical analysis in 
Perl:
he consumes the input using substitution
(<code class="prettyprint">s/ ... / ... /</code>) commands.
<p>

</p>
The other strategy is to use the Perl regex search position
to track the progress of the lexical analysis.
In the search-position strategy,
your cases consist of a lot of 
match commands using the <code class="prettyprint">\G</code> anchor
and the <code class="prettyprint">gc</code> modifier:
<code class="prettyprint">m/\G ... /gc</code>.
An excellent tutorial on this
kind of lexing,
albeit in a non-Marpa context,
can be found in
<a href="#DOMINUS">Mark Jason Dominus's book,
<cite>Higher Order Perl</cite></a>.
Mark's coverage of lexing is in
Chapter 8, "Parsing", on pages 359-375.
Mark's book can be read
<a href="http://hop.perl.plover.com/book/">
on-line</a>.
I highly recommend Mark's book
and own a paper copy.
