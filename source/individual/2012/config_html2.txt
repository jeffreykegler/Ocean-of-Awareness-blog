A configurable HTML parser, part 2
    <p>

      -->
      My last post introduced Marpa::R2::HTML,
      a configurable HTML parser.
      By editing a configuration file,
      the user can change,
      over a very wide range,
      the variant of HTML
      that Marpa::R2::HTML parses.
      The previous post showed one of the simplest variations --
      the ability to specify the contents of new tags,
      and the context in which they can appear.
      <p>
      This post is about a more aggressive variation of
      the HTML grammar -- the ability to change the contents
      of the HTML body (the
      <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>
      element.
      <h3>How is changing the HTML body useful?</h3>
      Marpa::R2::HTML allows changing the contents of all pre-existing
      element, with the exception of the highest level one --
      the 
      <tt>&lt;html&gt;</tt> element itself.
      This can be more impressive than utilitarian,
      but in the case of th 
      <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>
      element there is a real case to be made for allowing the
      application to choose.
      <h3>Can text appear directly in an HTML body?</h3>
      <p>Can text appear directly in an HTML
      <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>
      element.
      That is, must text inside an HTML
      <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>
      be part of one of its child elements,
      or can it be directly part of the contents
      of the 
      <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt> element?
      <p>
      The answer according to the standards depends on
      which standard you read.
      According the 
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-html40-19990824/sgml/dtd.html#inline">
        HTML 4.01 Strict DTD</a>,
	the answer is "No, text must be in the contents of a child element".
	Implementations of HTML were encouraged to be liberal, however,
	and in practice so much of the HTML out there has text directly
	in
      <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt> elements,
      that a browser is expected to allow it.
	Recognize existing practice,
	HTML 5 changed to require conforming implementations to
	allow text to appear directly in a 
      <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt>.
      <h3>Block flow contents versus mixed flow contents
      <p>
      Actually the question I am posing is part of a broader one.
      In the HTML 4.01 DTD, a
      <tt>&lt;body&gt;</tt> element
      contains a flow of
      <tt>%block</tt> compon -- which I will call a block flow.
