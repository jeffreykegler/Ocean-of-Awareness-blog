What's new with Marpa
<p>
Here's the Marpa "news" from the past few weeks.
(Marpa is a new, powerful and fast parser and parsing algorithm.

<h2>Revision to the Theory paper</h2>
<p>
Most of my effort over the past weeks
has gone into a paper
on the math behind Marpa.
I have just uploaded
<a href="http://github.com/downloads/jeffreykegler/Marpa-theory/recce.pdf">
a revised version</a>.
I've fixed several typos, including a few nasty ones,
for which I apologize.
I've also improved the typography
and smoothed out
the presentation in many places.
The basic structure and results of the paper
are unchanged.
The paper contains pseudocode,
a correctness proof,
and proofs of my complexity claims.
</p>
<h2>Deleting old releases</h2>
<p>
I plan to remove official releases
of the various Marpa distributions
(Marpa, Marpa::XS, Marpa::PP)
that are more than one or two versions old.
My guess is that this will release
some disk space, and inconvenience nobody.
</p>
<h2>Updating the distributions</h2>
<p>
Marpa::XS and Marpa::PP will be updated to make
them compatible with a new release of Carp.
Carp changed the format of one
of its error messages,
and since I test diagnostics,
the change causes my test suite to fail.
Testing diagnostics has paid off for me,
but I am updating my tests to be less fussy
about the exact format of Carp's feedback.
I do NOT plan to update the bare name Marpa,
which is an older,
deprecated and legacy release.
</p>
<h2>Marpa::R2</h2>
<p>
I continue to work on Marpa::R2,
whose first release will feature a 20% speedup,
and a documented C language interface.
For applications which need stability (and
in parsing that's most of them)
please prefer Marpa::XS.
But I hear from lots of people who want to
do things like write new Marpa interfaces,
and the main goal of Marpa::R2 is to give
them a clear road ahead.
<h2>Milarepa</h2>
<p>
Also underway is another revision of Marpa,
called Milarepa.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milarepa">
Jetsun Milarepa</a> was Tibet's most
notorious black magician.
Responsible for the deaths of dozens
of his enemies,
Milarepa repented
and begged Marpa to take him on
as a student.
Penniless students were often
treated by the teachers of the time as
more or less slaves,
and Marpa made a point of being
unusually harsh to the feared Milarepa.
Milarepa persevered, and went on to become
Marpa's successor and a poet beloved to Tibetans.
</p>
<p>
My Milarepa project will take the Theory side
of Marpa one step further.
The difference between the Milarepa
and the Marpa::R2 project is that,
when my plans involve new code,
they become part of Marpa::R2.
If my plans are at the mathematical stage,
they are,
for the moment,
part of the Milarepa project.
