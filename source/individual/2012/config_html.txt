A Configurable HTML Parser
    <p>
      <!--

      This post introduces an HTML parser which is both liberal and configurable.
      I have already explained some of the ideas behind it -- others are new.
      It may be best that I start with a simple example.
      Consider this piece of very defective html:
<pre>
I am too impatient to wait for a start tag.
<p>I was more patient.
</pre>
Displayed, it will look roughly like this:
<pre>
I am too impatient to wait for a start tag.

I was more patient.
</pre>
