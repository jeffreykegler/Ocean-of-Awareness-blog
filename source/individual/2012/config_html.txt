A Configurable HTML Parser
    <p>

      This post introduces an HTML parser which is both liberal and configurable.
      Marpa::R2::HTML allows detailed 
      configuration of new tags
      and reconfiguration of existing tags,
    </p><p>
      In this post, I'd like to start simple.
      Let's suppose we have a new tag, call it
      <code>
        &lt;marpa&gt;</code>.
      Already, the non-configurable version of Marpa, like most browsers,
      would recognize this tag.
      But they'd simply give it a default configuration,
      one which is usually very liberal --
      liberal meaning it allowed the tag to contain just about anything,
      and go just about anywhere.
      Let's try to be more restrictive.

      Block vs. inline</h1><p>
      In this post
      I am going to assume that the reader knows,
      or will look up what he needs to know,
      about HTML.
      But block vs. inline is a essential HTML concept
      which is often ignored -- even the excellent Wikipedia page on HTML
      does not define "inline", although it uses the term in the technical
      sense twice.
      Since the concept is also central to this post,
      let me briefly summarize it.
    </p><p>
      Quoting from the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-html40-19990824/sgml/dtd.html#inline">
        HTML 4.01 Strict DTD</a>,
    </p><blockquote>
      <pre>
      HTML has two basic content models:

        %inline;     character level elements and text strings
        %block;      block-like elements e.g. paragraphs and lists
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      There is also what I will call a "mixed flow",
      which can contain anything that
      can appear in either a block or inline flow.
      (What I call a mixed flow is
      simply called a "flow"
      in the HTML 4.01 DTD.)
    </p><p>
      Archetypal elements are
      <code>
        &lt;p&gt;</code>,
      which is a block element that contains an inline flow;
      <code>
        &lt;span&gt;</code>,
      which is an inline element that contains an inline flow;
      and
      <code>
        &lt;div&gt;</code>,
      which is an block element that contains an mixed flow.
    </p>
