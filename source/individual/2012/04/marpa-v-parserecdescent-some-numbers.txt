Marpa v. Parse::RecDescent: some numbers
<h2>The application</h2>
<p>In
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/polettix/2012/04/parserecdescent-and-number-of-elements-read-on-the-fly.html">
a recent blog post</a>,
Flavio Poletti described an unusual language,
one which he'd written a parser for,
using the very traditional method of
recursive descent.
Specifically he'd used Perl's Parse::RecDescent
module.
Several people asked me how
<a href="http://www.jeffreykegler.com/marpa">
Marpa</a>
would do on this language.
This post contains
a comparison, including a benchmark.

The reader who wants an exact description should
look at
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/polettix/2012/04/parserecdescent-and-number-of-elements-read-on-the-fly.html">
Flavio's post and code</a>.
I call it a Dyck-Hollerith language because it
combines
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollerith_constant">
Hollerith constants</a>

(strings preceded by a count),
with balanced parentheses
(what is called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyck_language">
a Dyck language</a>
by mathematicians).
Here's Flavio's example:
<code class="prettyprint">
<pre>
A2(A2(S3(Hey)S13(Hello, World!))S5(Ciao!))
</pre>
</code>

When I did
<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/jeffrey_kegler/2011/11/marpa-v-perl-regexes-some-numbers.html">
a Marpa versus Perl regexes comparison</a>,
I was very careful to choose an application which showed Marpa in
a good light.
Here I did not pick the application,
and it is almost as if it was designed
to show recursive descent in a good light.
</p>
<p>

Recursive descent tries to parse by treating each rule
as a subroutine call.
This is a very natural way for a programmer
to look at a grammar.
But, alas, it only works in certain cases,
and most of those are already handled by regular expressions.
However, Dyck languages, including balanced parentheses,
are one of the boundary cases:
languages beyond the abilities of regular expressions,
but within the capabilities of recursive descent.
</p>
<p>
Hollerith constants highlight the other strength of
recursive descent.
Since recursive descent's basic idea is so intuitive, it is easy
to add custom hacks to it.
And Hollerith constants are beyond the capabilities of even
general BNF parsing.
Earley's, Marpa, CYK, GLR, you name it,
none of them can handle Hollerith constants without
some kind of custom hack.
You might say that Hollerith constants force a parser
to wrestle in the mud.
And when it comes to wrestling in the mud,
recursive descent is hard to beat.
