      In the 1960's and 1970's computer languages were evolving rapidly
      and even the most basic questions were up in the air.
      In the future, they wondered, would programmers use
      General-purpose languages?
      Or special languages for specific kinds of tasks, what
      today we would call them DSL's?
      The questions they asked then were bolder
      than the questions being asked today,
      and their answers were bolder.

      In a 19xx paper, Culik and Cohen asked
      "What kinds of languages are reasonable to use as programming languages?"
      In their answer they assumed not only that users would want,
      in routine practice to extend the syntax of their languages with new
      kinds of expressions,
      but that they auto-generate such languages,
      and that users would expect them to be parsed in linear time,
      even if they required infinite lookahead.
