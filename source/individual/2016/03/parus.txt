      In this post I look at a subset of the language
      of the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_tit">
        Japanese great tit</a>,
      also known as Parus major.
      The above cited article presents evidence
      that bird brains can parse this language.
      What about standard modern computer parsing methods?
      Here is the subset -- probably a tiny one --
      of the language actually used by Parus major.
    </p><blockquote><pre>
      S ::= ABC
      S ::= D
      S ::= ABC D
      S ::= D ABC
    </pre></blockquote><p>
    </p>
    <h2>Classifying the Parus major grammar</h2>
    <p>Grammophone is a very handy
      <a href="http://mdaines.github.io/grammophone/#">
        new tool</a>
      for classifying grammars.
      It's own parser is somewhat limited, so that it requires a period
      to mark the end of a rule.
      The above grammar is in Marpa's SLIF format, which is smart enough to
      use the "<tt>::=</tt>"
      operator to spot the beginning and end of rules,
      just as the human eye does.
      Here's the same grammar converted into a form acceptable to Grammophone:
    </p><blockquote><pre>
      S -> ABC .
      S -> D .
      S -> ABC D .
      S -> D ABC .
    </pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      Grammophone tells us that the Parus major grammar is not LL(1),
      but that it is LALR(1).
    </p>
    <h2>What does this mean?</h2>
    <p>LL(1) is the class of grammar parseable by top-down methods:
      it's the best class for characterizing most parsers in current use,
      including recursive descent, PEG,
      and Perl 6 grammars.
      All of these parsers fall short of dealing with the Parus major language.
    </p><p>
      LALR(1) can handle this subset of Parus's language,
      but we can assume they would also reject it.
      LALR(1), in the form of bison and yacc,
      had been popular, but it has horrible error handling properties.
      When the input is correct and within its limits,
      an LALR-driven parser can produce a parse,
      But if the input is not correct, LALR parsers do not produce
      a useful analysis of what went wrong.
      If Parus hears "d abc d",
      a parser like Marpa, on the other hand, can produce something like
      this:
    </p>
    <blockquote><pre>
# * String before error: abc d\s
# * The error was at line 1, column 7, and at character 0x0064 'd', ...
# * here: d
    </pre></blockquote>
    <p>
      LALR(1), while able to handle this subset of Parus's language,
      has its own limits, and whether it could handle the full
      complexity of Parus
      language is a serious question.
      But it's a question that in practice would probably not arise.
      Parus uses its language in predatory contexts,
      and one can assume that a Parus with a preference for parsers whose
      error handling is on an LALR(1) level
      will not be keeping its alleles in the gene pool for very
      long.

      Those readers content with sub-Parus parsing methods may stop reading here.
      Those with greater parsing ambitions, however, may
      wish to learn more about Marpa.
