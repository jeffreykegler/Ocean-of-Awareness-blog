Significant whitespace?  Or semicolons?

      Should statements have explicit terminators, like Perl and C's semicolon?
      Or should they avoid the clutter, and separate statements by giving whitespace
      syntactic signifance and a real effect on
      the semantics?
      Actually you don't have to go either way,
      and you can avoid both sets of problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, let's look at some BNF-ish DSL.
      It defines a small calculator.
      At first glance, it looks as if this language has taken the
      significant-whitespace route -- there certainly are no explicit statement
      terminators.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
:default ::= action =&gt; ::first
:start ::= Expression
Expression ::= Term
Term ::=
      Factor
    | Term '+' Term action =&gt; do_add
Factor ::=
      Number
    | Factor '*' Factor action =&gt; do_multiply
Number ~ digits
digits ~ [\d]+
:discard ~ whitespace
whitespace ~ [\s]+
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>The rule is that there isn't one</h3>
    <p>
      If you use this DSL, and try natural rearrangements of the whitespace, you'll they
      just work.
      You might become curious about what exactly what the rules for newlines are,
      but if you look at
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Marpa-R2/pod/Scanless/DSL.pod">
      the documentation</a>,
      you won't find any.
      That's because there aren't any.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can see this for yourself.
      GNU's fmt command will thoroughly mess it up the line structure:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
:default ::= action =&gt; ::first :start ::= Expression Expression ::= Term
Term ::= Factor | Term '+' Term action =&gt; do_add Factor ::= Number |
Factor '*' Factor action =&gt; do_multiply Number ~ digits digits ~
[\d]+ :discard ~ whitespace whitespace ~ [\s]+
</pre>
</blockquote>
      <p>But the script will still run just fine, as you see from this Github gist.

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>How does it work?
      Actually, pose this question first:
      Can you tell where the statements end?
      If you not used to reading BNF, you might have trouble with this
      particular example but,
      for a language that you know, the answer is simple:
      Yes, of course you can.
      So really the question is,
      why do we expect the parser to be so stupid that it cannot?
    </p>
    <p>
      The only trick is that this is done without trickery.
      Marpa's DSL is
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/source/JKEGL/Marpa-R2-2.080000/lib/Marpa/R2/meta/metag.bnf">
      written in itself</a>,
      and Marpa's self-grammar describes exactly what a statement is
      and what it is not.
      The Marpa parser is powerful enough to simply take this self-describing DSL
      and act on it, finding where statements begin and end,
      much as a human reader
      would be able to in the same circumstance.

    <p>
      This example was produced with the Marpa parser.
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Marpa::R2">Marpa::R2
        is available on CPAN</a>.
	The code for this example is based on that in
	the synopsis for its top-level document,
	but it is isolated conveniently in a Github gist.
