<p>1960 -- The ALGOL 60 spec comes out.
It specifies, for the first time, a block structured
language.
As the ALGOL committee is well aware,
at this time
nobody know how to parse such a language.
<p>1961 -- Ned Irons publishes an ALGOL parser.
This is in fact the first parser of any kind ever described
in print.
It's a form of recursive descent, but unlike modern
recursive descent, the Irons algorithm
is general and syntax-driven.
"General" means it can parse anything written in BNF.
"Syntax-driven" (aka declarative) means that parser is
actually created from the BNF -- an Irons parser does not need
to be hand-written.
<p>1965 -- Don Knuth invents LR parsing.  Knuth is mainly interested
in the mathematics.
He describes a parsing algorithm,
but it is not thought practical.
<p>1968 -- Jay Earley invents the algorithm named after him.
It is also syntax-driven and fully general.  The core idea is to 
track everything about the parse in tables.
Earley's algorithm is enticing, but it has four serious issues.
First, there is a bug in the handling of null productions.
Second, it is quadratic for right recursions.
Third, the bookkeeping required to set up the tables is,
by the standards of 1968 hardware, daunting.
<p>
A fourth problem might be noted with Earley's algorithm --
there is no way to mix it with
hand-written, procedural logic.
This is not explicitly stated as a problem,
at least anywhere that I have seen,
but it definitely seems to have been felt.
By now, most parsers are left-parsers,
children of the Irons algorithm,
but hand-written instead of syntax-driven.
Left parsers turn out to be easy to custom hack.
<p>But the textbooks continue to discuss Earley's algorithm.
In 1972, one of these reports
a straightforward fix to the null-production bug in Earley's original algorithm.
Unfortunately, this fix involves even more bookkeeping to the algorithm.
The search for an efficient, powerful, syntax-driven algorithm
seem to be at a dead-end until ...
<p>In <b>1969</b>,
a PhD thesis by Frank DeRemer describes a new variant of Knuth's LR
parsing.
DeRemer's LALR algorithm requires only
a stack and a state table of quite
manageable size.
The world takes notice.
<p>In <b>1975</b>,
Bell Labs converts its C compiler from hand-written recursive
descent to DeRemer's LALR algorithm.
<p>In </b>1977<b>,
the first "Dragon book" comes out.
The nickname of this classic textbooks comes from the drawing
on the front cover, in which a knight takes on a dragon.
Emblazoned on his lance are the letters "LALR".
From here on,
to speak lightly of LALR will be to besmirch the escutcheon
of parsing theory.
Earley's original algorithm had a bug, to which Aho
and Ullman's vast two volume suggests a straightforward
remedy, but this fix slows
down an algorithm
whose speed was already an issue.
<p>In 1987, Larry Wall introduces Perl 1.
The very complex parsers of Perls 1 through 5
represent the
high water mark in the application of LALR.
Earley's algorithm, however,
has not been forgotten by everyone, because ...
<p>In 1991, Joop Leo discovers a way of speeding up right
recursions in Earley's algorithm.
With Leo's improvement, Earley's algorithm
is now linear for just about every unambiguous grammar of
practical interest, and many ambiguous ones as well.
And Earley's parsing is now very far off the radar.
Joop's paper
attracts no practical implementations for almost 20 years.
But, back in LALR-land,
there is growing discontent.
<p>In 2000, Larry Wall decides on a radical reimplementation
of Perl -- Perl 6.  He does not even consider using LALR again.
Practitioners have discovered that, while LALR automatically
generates a parser for you, it is so hard to debug that it's
just as easy to write one by hand.
Worse, once written, an LALR parser,
while efficient with correct inputs,
provides little clue as to why an incorrect input is correct.
In Larry's words, LALR is "fast but stupid".
Discontent with LALR
is also spreading inside academia ...
<p>In <b>2002</b>
Aycock&Horspool describe a attempt to speed up Earley's in practice.
Buried in their paper is a solution to the null-production bug --
one that requires no additional bookkeeping.
They do not include Joop Leo's improvement --
they seem not to be aware of it.
And their own speedup is limited in what it achieves
and introduces complications.
The Aycock&Horpsool has little effect on practical parsing.
On the other hand,
nothing can slow the fall of LALR from favor.
<p>In <b>2006</b>,
GNU announces that the GCC compiler's parser has been
completely rewritten.
For past three decades, the flagship C compilers had been
parsed with LALR.
No more.
LALR is replaced by the 1960's technology that
it originally replaced.
Recursive descent is the once-and-future algorithm.
<p>The retreat from LALR causes a collapse in the
prestige of parsing theory.
The result of more than a half century of
research is exactly zero.
If you took Ned Iron's original 1961 algorithm,
and republished it today under another name,
you could easily describe it as
being not just state of the art,
but as having ground-breaking new features as well.
<p><b>2010</b>: Marpa.
During all these years,
I'd never lost that original vision -- efficient, practical, powerful
syntax-driven parsing.
In 2010, I noticed that the pieces were all now in place.
Aycock&Hospool has solved the null-production bug.
Joop Leo had found the speedup for right recursion.
The bookkeeping had long since ceased to be an issue -- not
machines perform operations a billion faster than in 1968,
and in any case have been replaced by caches misses as the most
relevant metric for practical timings.
