      Marpa has a new official public website,
      which Ron Savage has generously agreed to manage.
      Marpa, for those who have not heard of it,
      is a parsing algorithm.
      It is new, but very much based
      on the prior work of Jay Earley, Joop Leo, John Aycock and R. Nigel Horspool.
      Marpa is intended to replace, and to go well beyond,
      recursive descent and the yacc family of parsers.

      <li>
        Marpa is fast. It parses in linear time:
        <ul>
          <li>All the grammars that recursive descent parses.
          </li>
          <li>All grammars that the yacc family parses.
          </li>
          <li>
            In fact, all unambiguous grammars, as long as they are free of unmarked middle recursions.
          </li><li>
            All the ambiguous grammars that are unions of a finite set of any of the above grammars.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Marpa is powerful. Marpa will parse anything you can write in BNF,
        including any mixture of left, right and middle recursion, as well as cycles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Marpa is flexible. Like recursive descent, Marpa allows you to stop and
        do your own custom processing. Unlike recursive descent, Marpa makes available
        to you detailed information about the parse so far --
        which rules and symbols have been recognized, with their locations,
        and which rules and symbols are expected next.
      </li>
      <li>Marpa is convenient.
      Unlike recursive descent, you do not have to write a parser,
      Marpa generates one for you from your BNF.
      Unlike PEG or yacc, parser generation is unrestricted and accurate:
      Marpa generates every BNF grammar into a parser which recognizes exactly
      the language described by that BNF, and nothing else.
      If a rule allows multiple alternatives, all of them are always
      considered -- you are not forced to choose one of them arbitrarily.
      </li>
      </ul>
