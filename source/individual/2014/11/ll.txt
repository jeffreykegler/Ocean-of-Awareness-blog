    <p>Parsing has a reputation of being an esoteric
        mathematical discipline -- which it can be.
        But, in spite of the way it is usually presented,
        its basic concepts are not especially difficult.
        </p>
        <p>Left parsing's basic idea is as simple as they come --
        you look at the next symbol and make your parsing decision
        based on it.
        This is simple but limited, so left parsing is almost
        combined with with lookahead.
        Lookahead of one character helps a lot, but for lookahead
        of more than one character
        the size of the parser grows exponentially, and its
        usefulness plummets.
        <p>It's straightforward to see that this approach will have
        problems with left recursion.
        If you have an expression like
        <blockquote><pre>
        a + b + c + d + e + f + [....]
        </pre></blockquote>
        where the plus signs continue off to the right,
        you cannot make the parsing decision at the first '+' unless
        you know how many more to come.
        And, without doing a lot of looking to the right,
        you cannot know.
        There are a lot of approaches to dealing with this difficulty,
        but all of them involve trying to make left parsing into
        something it is not.
    <h3>Advantages of left parsing</h3>
    <p>Left parsing is now the dominant approach in parsing which,
    considering how myopic it is, should surprise more people than it
    does.
