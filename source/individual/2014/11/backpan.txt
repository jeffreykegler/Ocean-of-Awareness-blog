    <p>Marpa::XS, Marpa::PP, and Marpa::HTML are obsolete versions of
      Marpa, which I have been keeping on CPAN for the convenience of legacy
      users.
      All new users should look only at
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-R2">Marpa::R2</a>.
    </p><p>
      I plan to delete the obsolete releases from CPAN soon.
      For legacy users who need copies, they will still be available on backPAN.
    </p><p>
      I do this because their placement on CPAN placement makes them "attractive nuisances" --
      they show up in searches and generally make it harder to find
      <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-R2">Marpa::R2</a>,
      which is the version that new users should be interested in.
      There is also some danger a new user could, by mistake, use the
      obsolete versions instead of Marpa::R2.
    </p><p>
      It's been some time since someone has reported a bug in their code,
      so they should be stable for legacy applications.
      I would usually promise to fix serious bugs that affect legacy users,
      but unfortunately, especially in the case of Marpa::XS,
      it is a promise I would have trouble keeping.
      Marpa::XS depends on Glib, and uses a complex build which I last performed
      on a machine I no longer use for development.
    </p><p>
      For this reason, a re-release to CPAN with deprecatory language is also not an option.
      I probably would not want to do so anyway -- the CPAN infrastructure by default
      pushes legacy
      users into upgrading, which always carries some risk.
      New deprecatory language would add no
      value for the legacy users,
      and they are the only audience these releases exist to serve.
